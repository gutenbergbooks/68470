  <p class="drop-cap">I REGRET that pressure of other work has prevented the
    completion of this Volume within a reasonable time since
    the publication of Volume I. Had Volume II been written
    ten years ago, the discoveries made in the course of the last
    decade would have given an out-of-date character to much
    of the subject-matter. It is more especially in regard to the
    Ferns and the extinct members of the Gymnosperms that our
    outlook has been materially altered by recent contributions to
    Palaeobotany. It is, however, some satisfaction to be able to
    add that recent progress has been relatively slight in that part
    of the subject dealt with in the first volume.</p>

  <p>The original intention was to complete the whole work in
    two volumes. Soon after the second volume was begun, it
    became evident that the remaining divisions of the plant-kingdom
    could not be included within the compass of a single
    volume. I decided, therefore, to take the consequences of
    having embarked on too ambitious a plan of treatment, and
    to preserve uniformity of proportion by reserving the seed-bearing
    plants for a third volume. The third volume will
    include the Pteridosperms, other than those briefly described
    in the final chapter of the present volume, and other classes of
    Gymnosperms. I propose also to devote such space as is
    available within the limits of a text-book to the neglected
    subject of the geographical distribution of plants at different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
    stages in the history of the earth. It is my intention to
    complete Volume III with as little delay as possible. As I
    have written elsewhere, the past history of the Flowering
    plants needs special treatment, and anything more than a mere
    compilation can be adequately attempted only after considerable
    research and with the assistance of botanists possessing
    a special knowledge of different families of Angiosperms. The
    need of a critical examination of available data in regard to
    the geological history of this dominant group will not be lost
    sight of.</p>

  <p>I am well aware that while certain genera have received
    an undue share of attention in the present volume, others
    have been ignored or treated with scant consideration. For
    this inconsistency I have no excuse to offer, beyond the statement
    that the subject is a large one, and selection is necessary
    even though the work consists of three volumes.</p>

  <p>The publication in 1909 of a collection of excellent photographs
    of Palaeozoic Plants, with brief descriptive notes, by
    Mr Newell Arber, as one of a series of popular “Nature Books,”
    bears striking testimony to the remarkable spread of interest
    in the study of the vegetation of the past, which is one of the
    outstanding features in the recent history of botanical science.</p>

  <p>In the list of illustrations I have mentioned the source of
    all figures which have been previously published. I would,
    however, supplement the statement of fact with an expression
    of thanks to corporate bodies and to individuals who have
    allowed me to make use of blocks, drawings, or photographs.</p>

  <p>I wish to thank my colleague, Mr A. G. Tansley, for placing
    at my disposal several blocks originally published in the pages
    of the <i>New Phytologist</i>. To Professor Bertrand of Lille and to
    his son Dr Paul Bertrand I am indebted for several prints and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
    descriptive notes of specimens in their possession. My friends
    Dr Nathorst of Stockholm and Dr Zeiller of Paris have generously
    responded to my requests for information on various
    points. I wish especially to thank Dr Kidston for several
    excellent prints of specimens in his collection and for the loan
    of sections. I have profited by more than one examination of
    his splendid collection at Stirling. Professor Weiss has generously
    allowed me to borrow sections from the Manchester
    University collections, more especially several which have been
    reproduced in the chapter devoted to the genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    To Professor F. W. Oliver my thanks are due for the loan
    of sections from the collection under his charge at University
    College. I have pleasure also in thanking Dr Scott, not only
    for lending me sections of a Lepidodendron and for allowing
    me to use some drawings of <i>Miadesmia</i> originally made by
    Mrs Scott for reproduction in his invaluable book, <i>Studies in
    Fossil Botany</i>, but for kindly undertaking the laborious task
    of reading the proofs of this volume. It would be unfair to
    express my gratitude to Dr Scott for many helpful suggestions
    and criticisms, without explicitly stating that thanks to a
    friend for reading proofs must not be interpreted as an attempt
    to claim his support for all statements or views expressed.
    The General Editor of the Series, Mr A. E. Shipley, has also
    kindly read the proofs. I am under obligations also for assistance
    of various kinds to Prof. Thomas of Auckland, New
    Zealand, to Mr Boodle of Kew, to Mr D. M. S. Watson of
    Manchester, to Mr T. G. Hill of University College, and to
    Mr Gordon of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. I am indebted
    to the kind offices of Miss M. C. Knowles for the photograph
    of the specimen of <i>Archaeopteris hibernica</i> in the Irish National
    Museum, Dublin, reproduced on <a href="#fig368">page 561</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

  <p>Many of the illustrations are reproduced from drawings
    by my wife: those made from the actual specimens are distinguished
    by the addition of the initials M. S. I am grateful
    to her also for some improvements in the letter-press. For the
    drawings made from sections and for some of the outline
    sketches I am responsible. I have availed myself freely of
    the facilities afforded by Professor McKenny Hughes in the
    Sedgwick Museum of Geology for the examination of specimens
    under the charge of Mr Newell Arber, the University
    Demonstrator in Palaeobotany. It is a pleasure to add that,
    as on former occasions, I am indebted to the vigilance of the
    Readers of the University Press for the detection of several
    errors which escaped my notice in the revision of the proofs.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">SPHENOPHYLLALES (<i>concluded</i>).</div>

  <h4><a id="Sphenophyllum"><i>Sphenophyllum</i></a>.</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> account of the Sphenophyllales given in the first
    volume<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of this work must be extended and somewhat modified
    in the light of recent work on the fertile shoots of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni</i> (Will.) was described as consisting
    of an axis bearing superposed whorls of bracts connate at
    the base in the form of a shallow funnel-shaped collar giving
    off from the upper surface and close to the axis of the cone two
    concentric series of sporangiophores. Occasionally there are
    three series, as represented in <a href="#fig112">fig. 112</a>. In another type of
    strobilus, <i>Sphenophyllostachys Römeri</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> each sporangiophore
    terminates in two pendulous sporangia (<a href="#fig113">fig. 113</a>, A; see also fig.
    107, C, vol. <span class="allsmcap">I</span>.). It has already been pointed out that the common
    occurrence of detached strobili necessitates their description
    under distinct specific names; it is only by a rare accident
    that we can assign fossil cones to their vegetative shoots. There
    are, however, reasons for believing that <i>Sphenophyllostachys
      Dawsoni</i> is the strobilus of the plant originally described by
    Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from impressions of foliage-shoots as <i>Rotularia cuneifolia</i>.
    Another difficulty presented by petrified material is that
    of determining, with certainty, whether two imperfect specimens,
    differing from one another in features which do not appear to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>be of sufficient importance to warrant specific separation, are
    forms of one species or portions of specifically distinct cones.
    It has been pointed out by Scott<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that the strobilus known as
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni</i> probably includes two distinct
    species, one being the cone of <i>Sphenophyllum cuneifolium</i>
    Sternb., and the other the cone of <i>S. myriophyllum</i> Crép<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
    The stem of <i>S. myriophyllum</i> agrees anatomically with the type
    known as <i>Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum</i> Will. and Scott<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig112">
    <img class="illowp50" src="images/fig112.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption chang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 112. Sketch of a radial longitudinal section of <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>.
      There are usually two concentric series of sporangia on the sporophylls,
      not three as shown in the figure. The upper figure (after Zeiller) shows
      the linear bracts in surface-view.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to the two types of cone already mentioned,
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni</i> and <i>S. Römeri</i>, others have
    been described by Kidston from carbonised impressions. One
    of these is the fertile branch of <i>Sphenophyllum majus</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The
    basal portions of the bracts of each whorl form a narrow collar
    round the axis of the cone; the free portion of each bract
    consists of a lamina divided into two equal bifid lobes bearing
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>on its upper surface one group, or possibly two groups, of four
    sessile sporangia between the narrow coherent bases of the
    laminae and the sinus between the terminal lobes (<a href="#fig113">fig. 113</a>, C).
    Another characteristic feature is the greater length of the
    internodes; this renders the cone less compact and less sharply
    differentiated from the vegetative shoots than those of other
    species. A specimen in Dr Kidston’s collection illustrates the
    peculiar character of the fertile portion of this species; it consists
    of an axis bearing a succession of lax sporophylls succeeded
    above and below by whorls of sterile leaves. In this species,
    therefore, we cannot speak of a compact strobilus at the end of
    a shoot of limited growth, but of axes in which sterile and
    fertile leaves are borne alternately<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, a condition recalling the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>alternation of foliage leaves and sporophylls in <i>Tmesipteris</i>
    and in <i>Lycopodium Selago</i>.</p>

    other species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>,” and by sessile sporangia

  </div>

  <p>A more recent addition to our knowledge of the fertile
    shoots of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is due to Scott who has described a
    new type of cone under the name <i>Sphenophyllum fertile</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. The
    petrified specimen on which the species was founded was
    discovered by Mr James Lomax in the Lower Coal Measures of
    Lancashire; it represents a portion of a cone 6 cm. long and
    approximately 12 mm. broad. The axis contains a single
    vascular cylinder agreeing in essentials with the type of stem
    structure known as <i>Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum</i>. The nodal
    regions, which exhibit the slight swelling characteristic of the
    genus, bear several (probably twelve) appendages connate at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>the base and forming a narrow flange encircling the axis.
    Each bract, the base of which forms part of the narrow collar
    surrounding the axis, consists of two lobes, ventral and dorsal,
    divided palmately into several (sometimes four) segments or
    sporangiophores (<a href="#fig115">fig. 115</a>). Each sporangiophore terminates
    distally in an oblong or oval lamina bearing two sporangia on
    its adaxial face (<a href="#fig114">fig. 114</a>). The space between the axis and the
    periphery of the cone is thus occupied by crowded peltate
    laminae, each with its pair of sporangia. A single vascular
    bundle supplies each sporangiophore and bifurcates in the
    distal lamina into two branches which extend to the bases of
    the sporangia. The sporangia agree in structure with those of
    other species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>: the spores are of one size and
    elliptical, characterised by the presence of several sharp ridges
    or flanges encircling the spore-wall in the direction of the major-axis.
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys fertilis</i> differs from all previously
    recorded types in the absence of sterile bracts. The appendages
    of the cone-axis are all fertile, a striking contrast to the
    differentiation into protective and sporangia-bearing bracts which
    constitutes a constant feature in the cones of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    and <i>Calamites</i>. It is possible, as Scott suggests, that the
    absence of sterile segments is the result of modification of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
    more usual type of strobilus; instead of the dorsal and ventral
    lobes of the bracts sharing between them the duties of protection
    and spore-production, the whole of each bract is constructed
    on the plan of the maximum spore-output, the laminar terminations
    of the sporangiophores serving the purpose of protection.
    The cone may be described as more specialised than the normal
    type of strobilus for reproductive purposes<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

  <p>It has been stated, on evidence which is unsatisfactory, that
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> possesses two kinds of spores. While regarding
    the genus as homosporous on the evidence before us, it is
    interesting to find that cases occur in which the spores in the
    same sporangium exhibit a marked difference in size. Attention
    has been called by Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to variation in the
    dimensions of spores: a more pronounced difference in size has
    been recorded by Mr Thoday<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who gives 120μ as the maximum
    and 90μ as the minimum diameter of the spores in a cone of
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni</i>. The presence of several abortive
    spores in the sporangium (<a href="#fig116">fig. 116</a>) containing the larger
    spores favours the view that this difference in size may be the
    first step towards the development of heterospory.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>It is clear that the types of strobilus designated <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>
    (<a href="#fig112">figs. 112–114</a>) present a divergence of characters
    too great to be comprised under one genus; but in the absence
    of fuller information, we cannot do otherwise than follow the
    only logical custom of grouping them together as examples of
    strobili borne by plants which, in the present state of our
    knowledge, are most conveniently referred to the genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Cheirostrobus"><i>Cheirostrobus.</i></h4>

  <p>This generic name was applied by Dr Scott<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to a calcified
    cone obtained by Mr James Bennie in 1883 from the Lower
    Carboniferous plant-beds of Pettycur near Burntisland on the
    Firth of Forth. <i>Cheirostrobus</i> is distinguished from <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>
    by its greater breadth (3.5 cm.); externally it
    agrees more closely with the fertile shoots of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    than with those of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. A single vascular cylinder
    having the form of a fluted Doric column (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, B, <i>x</i>)
    occupies the axis of the cone: it consists for the most part of
    reticulate tracheae which tend to assume a short or isodiametric
    form in the central region; the smaller protoxylem tracheids
    with the spiral form of pitting constitute the sharp and
    prominent ridges at the periphery of the xylem-cylinder. In
    the outer part of the cylinder the metaxylem<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> consists exclusively
    of tracheae, but towards the centre of the axis these are
    associated with numerous parenchymatous cells.</p>

  <p>The xylem is therefore centripetal in origin as in <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    and in nearly all recent and fossil members of the
    Lycopodiales. In the type-specimen of <i>Cheirostrobus</i> the
    vascular cylinder of the cone consists entirely of primary xylem,
    but secondary xylem has been found in a more recently discovered
    specimen<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Secondary xylem occurs also in the
    peduncle of the cone. No appreciable remains of phloem have
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>been found. The cortex consists of slightly elongated rather
    thick-walled tissue containing secretory sacs. Crowded superposed
    whorls of bracts (or sporophylls), usually twelve in each
    whorl, are borne on the axis and each sporophyll receives a
    single vascular bundle from one of the vertical ridges of the
    xylem column (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, A, <i>lt</i>). The members of each whorl
    are connate at the base: from this narrow collar each sporophyll
    branches into an upper or dorsal and a lower or ventral limb
    (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, A, <i>f</i> and <i>s</i>). Each limb divides palmately at a short
    distance from its origin into three slender segments, which
    extend in a horizontal direction and terminate in large laminar
    expansions (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, B, <i>s</i>) to afford a protective covering to the
    surface of the cone. The upper set of three segments, constituting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
    sporangiophores (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, A, B, <i>f</i>) or fertile divisions
    of the sporophyll, expand distally into comparatively bulky
    laminae; each of these bears on its adaxial face four diagonally
    placed outgrowths which form the short pedicels of very long
    and narrow sporangia. The three lower segments—the sterile
    divisions of the sporophylls—(<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, A, B, <i>s</i>) are similar to
    the upper set except in their greater length and in the kite-shaped
    form of their distal laminae which are provided with
    lateral lobes. The single vascular strand which supplies each
    sporophyll is represented at <i>lt</i> in <a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, B; at <i>lt′</i> the strand
    has divided into four, the three upper bundles in the figure
    supply the sterile segments and the single lower bundle
    ultimately divides into three which supply the fertile segments.
    A pair of blunt processes (fig. A, <i>s</i>) extend downwards over the
    ends of the underlying fertile lamina and two slender prolongations
    extend upwards through several internodes.</p>

  <p>An economical arrangement of the long and narrow sporangia
    and of the sporophyll-segments between the axis and the
    periphery of the cone is rendered possible by the interlocking
    of the sterile and fertile segments by means of a groove in the
    upper face of the latter for the accommodation of the former.
    The sporangia are characterised by their unusually long and
    narrow form: the length of a sporangium may reach
    1 centimetre. In the structure of the wall the sporangia of
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i> agree closely with those of <i>Calamostachys</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>. The spores are of one size only. The
    vascular cylinder of the peduncle, originally described by
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as the peduncle of a large <i>Lepidostrobus</i> (the cone
    of <i>Lepidodendron</i>), is characterised by the presence of a short
    radially disposed zone of secondary tracheids, a feature, as
    Scott points out, which may extend into the axis of the cone.
    It is noteworthy that the protoxylem elements are not always
    external, but occasionally occur internal to one or two of the
    outermost metaxylem tracheae: the usual exarch<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> structure of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>the central cylinder is not therefore absolutely constant, but
    may be replaced by a mesarch arrangement.</p>

  <p>The presence of a few sterile leaves on the peduncle below
    the fertile portion of the cone, which agree in their lobed
    laminae with the sporophylls, is the only fact which we possess
    as to the form of the vegetative characters of the genus.</p>

  <p>The above description is sufficient to indicate the extraordinary
    complexity and high degree of specialisation of
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i>. The sporophylls, with their trilobed segments,
    and the crowded sporangia of exceptional length attached only
    by a narrow base constitute striking peculiarities of the genus.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate that we are still without any satisfactory
    evidence as to the nature of the plant the cones of which have
    been made the type of a new genus and a new family.
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i> affords an interesting example of a type of
    reproductive shoot constructed on a plan <i>sui generis</i>, and may
    be classed with some other extinct genera as instances of the
    production in the course of evolution of architectural schemes
    which appear to have been ill adapted for competition with
    equally efficient though much simpler types. But the discovery
    of these isolated forms of restricted geological range among
    the relics of the Palaeozoic vegetation frequently supplies a
    key to phylogenetic problems. <i>Cheirostrobus</i> by its complex
    combination of features characteristic of the Equisetales, the
    Lycopodiales and the genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i> throws a welcome
    light on the inter-relationships of groups which represent
    divergent series. The combination of morphological features
    in this generalised type led the author of the genus to describe
    it as a descendant of an old stock which existed prior to the
    divergence of the Equisetales and Lycopodiales.</p>

  <p>The discovery of this new type of strobilus naturally led to
    a search among Lower Carboniferous plants for vegetative shoots
    exhibiting characters conformable with the whorled and branched
    leaves of <i>Cheirostrobus</i>. In <i>Sphenophyllum</i> we have a genus
    obviously comparable with <i>Cheirostrobus</i> as regards the form
    and disposition of the leaves, but the differences between the
    cones and the striking similarity of the vascular cylinder of the
    latter to that of <i>Lepidodendron</i> demonstrate conclusively that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
    we must look elsewhere for the vegetative members of the
    plant which produced cones of the <i>Cheirostrobus</i> type.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PSEUDOBORNIA</div>

  <p>In 1902 Professor Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> instituted the generic name
    <i>Pseudobornia</i> for plants of which imperfect examples had
    previously been referred by Heer<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to <i>Calamites</i> under the name
    <i>C. radiatus</i>. Heer’s plants were obtained from Upper Devonian
    rocks of Bear Island in the Arctic seas and additional specimens
    were brought from the same locality by the Swedish Polar
    Expedition of 1898. <i>Pseudobornia</i> possesses jointed stems
    (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, D) bearing whorled and shortly stalked leaves, often
    four in number, at each node. The leaves are palmately
    branched with fine serrated edges (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, C). Certain
    specimens, which are no doubt correctly described by Nathorst
    as cones, are characterised by a thick axis bearing whorled
    leaves with sporangia on their lower surfaces, but the material
    is not sufficiently well preserved to render possible a recognition
    of structural details. It has been suggested by Scott that
    <i>Pseudobornia</i> may possibly be referable to the Sphenophyllales
    and that the stem of <i>Cheirostrobus</i> “may have had something
    in common with” Nathorst’s genus<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. The beds in which the
    stems occur are of Upper Devonian age, while <i>Cheirostrobus</i>
    was found in Lower Carboniferous rocks: this difference in
    age is not, however, a serious objection to the validity of the
    comparison. We cannot do more than express the view that
    <i>Pseudobornia</i>, so far as can be ascertained without an examination
    of petrified material or of more perfect impressions of
    strobili, exhibits vegetative features not inconsistent with the
    morphological characters of the fertile shoots known as
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i>.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>The institution of a special group-name for the reception of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is justified by the sum of its morphological
    features, which do not sufficiently conform to those of any
    existing group of Pteridophytes to warrant its inclusion in a
    system of classification based on recent genera. In the case of
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i> we are limited to the characters of the cone and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>its peduncle. The suggestion that the Devonian fossils known
    as <i>Pseudobornia</i> may represent the foliage shoots of a plant
    closely related to <i>Cheirostrobus</i> has still to be proved correct.
    Although we may find justification in the highly complex and
    peculiar structure of <i>Cheirostrobus</i> for the recognition of the
    genus as a type of still another group of Pteridophytes, it would
    be unwise to take this step without additional knowledge.</p>

  <p>The undoubted similarity between <i>Cheirostrobus</i> and
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> coupled with striking points of difference favours
    the inclusion of the two genera in distinct families placed, for
    the present at least, in the group Sphenophyllales.</p>

      </ul>

  </div>

  <p>It has recently been proposed to include the family
    Psilotaceae, comprising the two recent genera <i>Psilotum</i> and
    <i>Tmesipteris</i>, as another subdivision of the Sphenophyllales.
    This proposal had been made by Professor Thomas<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> primarily
    on the ground that the sporophylls of <i>Tmesipteris</i> and <i>Psilotum</i>
    appear to afford the closest parallel among existing plants to
    the peculiar form of sporophyll characteristic of the Sphenophyllales.
    The morphological interpretation of the sporophylls
    of both <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and <i>Cheirostrobus</i> has been the source
    of considerable discussion<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. If we regard each sporophyll as a
    leaf with two lobes, one fertile and one sterile, except in the
    case of <i>Sphenophyllostachys fertilis</i> in which both are fertile, an
    obvious comparison may be made with the fern <i>Ophioglossum</i>;
    but the difference between a single fern frond, consisting of a
    comparatively large sterile lamina bearing a fertile branch
    composed of a long axis with two rows of sporangia embedded
    in its tissues, and the whorled sporophylls of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is
    considerable.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PSILOTACEAE</div>

  <p>A brief reference may be made to the principal reasons which
    have led to the suggestion that the Psilotaceae should be included
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>in the Sphenophyllales. The shoots of <i>Tmesipteris</i> bear simple
    foliage leaves spirally disposed on a slender axis, and in
    association with these occur sporophylls consisting of a short
    axis bearing a pair of small lobes and a bilocular synangium<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
    (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, B). The synangium is seated on a very short stalk
    given off from its sporophyll at the base of the pair of laminae:
    the synangium with its short stalk may be spoken of as the
    sporangiophore. In most cases the synangium appears to be
    sessile on the sporophyll, but occasionally the much reduced stalk
    is prolonged and forms an obvious feature. Dr Scott<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> suggested
    that the Tmesipteris synangium with its axis may correspond
    to the ventral lobe (or sporangiophore) of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. In the
    latter genus the whorled sporophylls consist in most species of
    a dorsal and a ventral lobe, the latter serving as a sporangiophore
    bearing one or more sporangia; in <i>Tmesipteris</i> the
    sporophylls are spirally disposed and each consists of a bilobed
    sterile portion bearing a septate sporangium or bilocular
    synangium on a very short ventral lobe. Professor Bower<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, in
    his account of the development and structure of the sporophylls
    of <i>Tmesipteris</i>, drew attention to the comparatively frequent
    occurrence of abnormal sporophylls and spoke of the plant as
    unstable. More recently Professor Thomas<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of Auckland has
    carefully examined living plants, with the result that variations
    of different kinds are proved to be exceedingly common. He
    finds that sporophylls occur which exhibit repeated dichotomy
    of the axis (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, D, F) and thus each may bear four instead
    of two leaf-lobes and three synangia, one at the first fork and
    one at each of the forks of the second order<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

  <p>Other abnormalities occur in which the synangium is raised
    on a distinct stalk instead of being more or less sessile at
    the point from which the leaf-lobes diverge. A third form of
    departure from the normal is that in which there is no synangium
    on the bilobed sporophyll, its place being taken by a leaf-lobe.
    The deduction from the occurrence of these abnormalities is
    that the synangium of <i>Tmesipteris</i> represents a ventral leaf-lobe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    as Scott suggested. Professor Thomas draws attention to
    the resemblance between <i>Tmesipteris</i> sporophylls and the foliage-leaves
    of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, which are either simple with dichotomously
    branched veins or the lamina is deeply divided into
    two or more segments. In some types of <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>
    the bracts are simple (<i>S. Dawsoni</i>), but in others (<i>Sphenophyllum
    majus</i>, <a href="#fig113">fig. 113</a>, C) they are forked like the foliage-leaves
    and bear a close resemblance to the abnormal sporophylls of
    <i>Tmesipteris</i>. Moreover, in <i>Sphenophyllostachys Römeri</i> (<a href="#fig113">fig.
    113</a>, A) each ventral lobe of a sporophyll bears two sporangia,
    a condition almost identical with that represented by the
    occasional occurrence of a synangium on a comparatively
    long stalk in <i>Tmesipteris</i>. Similarly the more elaborate
    sporophylls of <i>Cheirostrobus</i> may be compared with the branched
    sporophylls of <i>Tmesipteris</i> (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>). This agreement between
    the sporophylls of the Palaeozoic and recent genera acquires
    additional importance from the very close resemblance between
    the exarch stele of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and that of the genus
    <i>Psilotum</i>, which conforms to the Palaeozoic type not only in
    the centripetal character of the primary xylem and in its exarch
    structure, but also in the occasional occurrence of secondary
    xylem<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and in the stellate form of its transverse section. The
    occasional mesarch structure of the stele of <i>Cheirostrobus</i> finds
    a parallel in the mesarch xylem groups in the stem of <i>Tmesipteris</i>.
    It is thus on the strength of these resemblances that Thomas
    and Bower would remove the Psilotaceae from the group
    Lycopodiales and unite them with <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and <i>Cheirostrobus</i>
    in the Sphenophyllales. While admitting the validity
    of the comparison briefly referred to above, I prefer to retain
    the Psilotaceae as a division of the Pteridophyta including only
    <i>Psilotum</i> and <i>Tmesipteris</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">SPHENOPHYLLUM</div>

  <p>In his recent book on <i>The Origin of Land Flora</i>, Prof. Bower
    raises objection to the use of the term ventral lobe in speaking of
    the sporangium-bearing stalk or sporangiophore borne on the
    sporophyll of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. He points out that the use of
    this term implies the derivation of the sporangiophore by
    metamorphosis of part of a vegetative leaf, an opinion untenable
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>in the absence of proof. The designation sporangiophore is no
    doubt preferable to that of ventral lobe as it carries with it
    no admission of particular morphological value; as a further
    concession to a non-committal attitude we may provisionally at
    least regard a sporangiophore as an organ <i>sui generis</i> “and not
    the result of modification of any other part<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.”</p>

  <p>The view put forward by Prof. Lignier<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that the Sphenophyllales
    are descendants of primitive ferns is not convincing,
    and his comparison of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> with <i>Archaeopteris</i> lacks
    force in view of our ignorance as to the nature of the reproductive
    organs of the latter genus. That the Sphenophyllales are
    connected with the Equisetales and with the Psilotales by
    important morphological features is clear; but the comparison
    between the sporophylls of the extinct genera with those of the
    existing genus <i>Tmesipteris</i>, though helpful and possibly based
    on true homology, cannot be considered as settling the morphological
    value of the sporangiophores of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i>.</p>

  <p>I do not propose to discuss at length the different views in
    regard to the morphological nature of the sporangiophore of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. The comparison, which we owe in the first
    instance to Scott, with the synangium of the Psilotales with its
    short stalk, though not accepted by Lignier as a comparison
    based on true homology, is one which appeals to many botanists
    and is probably the best so far suggested. The further question,
    whether these sporangiophores are to be called foliar or axial
    structures is one which has been answered by several authors,
    but it is improbable that we shall soon arrive at a decision likely
    to be accepted as final. Discussions of this kind tend to assume
    an exaggerated importance and frequently carry with them the
    implication that every appendage of the nature of a sporangiophore
    can be labelled either shoot or leaf. We treat the
    question from an academic standpoint and run a risk of
    ignoring the fact that the conception of stem and leaf is based
    on morphological characteristics, which have been evolved as
    the result of gradual differentiation of parts of one originally
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>homogeneous whole. There is much that is attractive in the
    view recently propounded by Mr Tansley that a leaf is not an
    appendicular organ differing <i>ab initio</i> from the axis on which it
    is borne, but that it is in phylogenetic origin a “branch-system
    of a primitive undifferentiated sporangium-bearing thallus<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.”
    Admitting the probability that this view is correct, our faith
    in the importance of discussions on the morphological nature of
    sporangiophores is shaken, and we realise the possibility that
    our zeal for formality and classification may lead to results
    inconsistent with an evolutionary standpoint<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Psilotum_and_Tmesipteris">PSILOTALES.</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> two recent genera <i>Psilotum</i> and <i>Tmesipteris</i> are usually
    spoken of as members of the family Psilotaceae which is
    included as one of the subdivisions of the Lycopodiales. It is
    probable, as Scott<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> first suggested, that these two plants are
    more nearly allied than are any other existing types to the
    Palaeozoic genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <p>We may give expression to the undoubted resemblances
    between <i>Tmesipteris</i> and <i>Psilotum</i> and the Sphenophyllales by
    including the recent genera as members of that group, originally
    founded on the extinct genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>; this is the
    course adopted by Thomas<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and by Bower<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>: or we may
    emphasise the fact that these two recent genera differ in
    certain important respects from <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i> by
    removing them to a separate group, the Psilotales. The latter
    course is preferred on the ground that the inclusion of <i>Psilotum</i>
    and <i>Tmesipteris</i> in a group founded on an extinct and necessarily
    imperfectly known type, is based on insufficient evidence and
    carries with it an assumption of closer relationship than has
    been satisfactorily established.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tmesipteris</i> (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, A) is represented by a
    single species <i>T. tannensis</i> Bertr.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which usually occurs as an
    epiphyte on the stems of tree-ferns in Australia, New Zealand,
    and Polynesia. <i>Psilotum</i>, with two species <i>P. triquetrum</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>Sw. (<a href="#fig118">fig. 118</a>) and <i>P. complanatum</i> Sw., flourishes in moist
    tropical regions of both hemispheres, growing either on soil
    rich in organic substances or as an epiphyte. Both genera
    are considered to be more or less saprophytic.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Psilotum.</i> The common tropical species <i>P. triquetrum</i>
    (<a href="#fig118">fig. 118</a>) is characterised by an underground rhizome which
    forms a confused mass of dark brown branches covered with
    filamentous hairs as substitutes for roots and gives off erect
    repeatedly forked aerial shoots. In <i>P. complanatum</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the habit
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>is similar to that of the more abundant and better-known
    species, but the pendulous shoots are characterised by their
    broader and flatter form. In both species the function of
    carbon-assimilation is performed by the outer cortex of the
    green branches, as the small size of the widely-separated
    foliage leaves renders them practically useless as assimilating
    organs.</p>

  <p>The sporophylls consist of a short axis terminating in two
    small divergent forks and bearing on its adaxial surface a
    trilocular or in rare cases a bilocular synangium (<a href="#fig118">fig. 118</a>, A
    and B). The walls of the loculi are composed of several layers
    of cells and dehiscence takes place along three lines radiating
    from the centre of the synangium. Professor Thomas<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> has
    recorded “fairly numerous instances in <i>Psilotum</i> of a second
    dichotomy of one branch of the first fork, or, less frequently, of
    both branches”: instead of one synangium subtended by the
    two slender leaflets of the forked sporophyll-axis, there may be
    two synangia and three leaf-lobes or three synangia and four
    leaf-lobes. The occurrence of both these abnormalities in
    <i>Psilotum</i> and <i>Tmesipteris</i> shows a decided tendency in the
    Psilotales to a repeated dichotomy of the sporophylls<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

  <p>A single stele<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> with a fluted surface occupies the axis of an
    aerial shoot (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>, A); the axial region is occupied by a
    core of elongated mechanical elements (<i>s</i>), which may occasionally
    extend to the periphery of the xylem and break the
    continuity of the band of scalariform tracheae (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>, A, <i>a</i>).
    The tracheae form the arms of an irregularly stellate stele and
    each arm is terminated by protoxylem elements (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>, B, <i>px</i>).
    The rays of the xylem cylinder, which may be as many as six
    or eight in the upper part of the aerial shoots, become reduced
    in number as the rhizome is approached, assuming a diarch
    structure near the junction. In the rhizome the xylem forms
    an approximately triangular group of tracheae without any
    core of mechanical elements. Three to four layers of parenchyma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
    succeeded externally by an ill-defined phloem (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>, A,
    <i>p</i>) surround the xylem and a fairly distinct endodermis (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>,
    A and B, <i>e</i>) encloses the whole. To Mr Boodle<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is due the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>interesting discovery that in some parts of the rhizome the
    parenchymatous zone surrounding the scalariform tracheae
    may become the seat of meristematic activity which results
    in the production of secondary tracheae often characterised
    by a sinuous longitudinal course. There is no definite
    cambium, but the radially disposed tracheae and the adjacent
    parenchymatous elements clearly demonstrate the secondary
    nature of the tissue immediately external to the group of
    primary xylem. Fig. 119, C, drawn from a section kindly
    supplied by Mr Boodle, shows the secondary xylem elements at
    <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> associated with radially disposed thin-walled cells abutting
    on the primary xylem, <i>x</i><sup>1</sup>. It is probable that this added tissue
    may be a remnant of a more extensive secondary thickening
    characteristic of the ancestors of the recent species. In their
    manner of occurrence and sinuous course these secondary
    tracheids bear a resemblance to the secondary xylem of
    <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. The stele of the aerial shoot bears
    a fairly close resemblance to the vascular axis of <i>Cheirostrobus</i>,
    and its three-rayed form in the lower portions of the green
    branches recalls that of the <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stele, except that
    the axial xylem elements of the Palaeozoic genus are usually
    represented in <i>Psilotum</i> by mechanical tissue. The cortex
    consists of three regions (<a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>, A), an outer zone of chlorophyllous
    tissue (<i>a</i>) rich in intercellular spaces succeeded by a
    band of mechanical tissue (<i>b</i>) which gradually passes into an
    inner region of larger and thinner-walled cells (<i>c</i>).</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TMESIPTERIS</div>

  <p>The genus <i>Tmesipteris</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> agrees with <i>Psilotum</i> in general habit
    and in its epiphytic and probably in some degree saprophytic
    mode of life. Its brown rootless rhizome, which grows among
    the roots of tree-ferns or rarely in the ground, gives off
    pendulous or erect shoots reaching a length of two feet and
    bearing lanceolate mucronate leaves 2–3 cm. long (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, A)
    attached by decurrent leaf-bases. The sporophylls, replacing
    the upper leaves or occurring in more or less well-defined zones
    alternating with the foliage leaves, consist of a short axis
    terminating in a pair of lanceolate lobes and bearing on its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>adaxial surface an elongated bilocular synangium attached to a
    very short stalk (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, B). Reference has already been
    made to the divergent opinions as to the morphological nature
    of the sporophylls or sporangiophores, but recent investigations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
    distinctly favour the view that a sporophyll is best interpreted
    as a stalked leaf with two sterile laminae and an almost sessile,
    or in some cases a more obviously stalked, synangium; the
    whole sporophyll is characterised by the possession of a ventral
    and a dorsal lobe<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. The drawings reproduced in <a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, D
    and F, illustrate some of the frequent variations described by
    Thomas in plants which he observed in the New Zealand
    forests. The sporophyll shown in <a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, D and F, has
    branched twice and bears three synangia.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The aerial branches of <i>Tmesipteris</i> possess a central
    cylinder of separate xylem groups in which the protoxylem
    occupies an internal position (<a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>, C and E, <i>px</i>) enclosing
    an axial parenchymatous region. The cells of a few layers of the
    inner cortex immediately outside the endodermis are rendered
    conspicuous by a dark brown deposit. The cortex as a whole
    is composed of uniform parenchymatous tissue. In the lower
    part of the aerial shoots and in the rhizome the xylem forms
    a solid strand without protoxylem elements and conforms more
    clearly to that of <i>Psilotum</i>.</p>

  <p>In this short account of the anatomy of <i>Tmesipteris</i> no
    mention is made of the effect produced on the stele by the
    departure of leaf-traces and of vascular stands to supply
    branches. Miss Sykes<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in a recently published paper on the
    genus has shown that the exit of a leaf-trace does not break
    the continuity of the xylem of the stele, while the exit of a
    sporophyll-trace is marked by an obvious gap. Evidence
    is adduced in support of the conclusion that this difference,
    which at first sight appears to be one of morphological importance,
    is in reality merely a question of degree and “is due to
    the earlier preparation for the formation of ‘sporophyll’ than
    leaf-traces.” Miss Sykes gives her adherence to the view that
    the “sporophylls” of <i>Tmesipteris</i> are branches and not leaves, but
    despite the arguments advanced this interpretation seems to
    me less probable than that which recognises the sporophyll as
    a foliar organ. Prof. Lignier<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> has pointed out that if Miss
    Sykes’s conclusion as to the axial nature of the sporophyll in
    <i>Tmesipteris</i> is accepted, it diminishes the force of the comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
    between the sporophylls of that genus and <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    as those of the latter can hardly be regarded as other
    than foliar organs.</p>

  <p>Both members of the Psilotales may, as Boodle has
    suggested, be regarded as descendants of a common parent in
    which the aerial stems possessed a fluted or stellate cylinder of
    mesarch xylem. There can be no doubt as to the significance
    of the morphological resemblances between the Psilotales and
    the genera <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and <i>Cheirostrobus</i>, but the position
    of <i>Tmesipteris</i> and <i>Psilotum</i> in the plant-kingdom may probably
    be best expressed by adopting the group-name Psilotales rather
    than by transferring the recent genera to the Sphenophyllales.
    One of the most striking differences between the Psilotales and
    the genus <i>Lycopodium</i> is in the form of the sporophylls and
    sporangia; in <i>Lycopodium</i> a single sporophyll bears a unilocular
    sporangium, but in the Psilotales the sporophyll may be
    described as a bilobed structure homologous with a foliage-leaf,
    bearing a sporangiophore which consists of a short stalk
    terminating in a bilocular or trilocular synangium; the short
    stalk receives a special branch from the vascular bundle of the
    sterile portion of the sporophyll<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Allied_to_Psilotum"><i>Fossils described by authors as being closely
    allied to</i> Psilotum.</h4>

  <p>A search through palaeobotanical literature reveals the
    existence of a very small number of specimens which have been
    identified as representatives of the Psilotales. An inspection of
    the material or published drawings leads one to the conclusion
    that practically no information of a satisfactory kind is
    available in regard to the past history of the two southern
    genera <i>Psilotum</i> and <i>Tmesipteris</i>, which are regarded by some
    botanists as relics of an ancient branch<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of pteridophytes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PSILOTITES, ETC.</div>

  <p>In 1842 Münster<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> instituted the genus <i>Psilotites</i> for a small
    impression of a slender branched axis from Jurassic rocks near
    Mannheim in Germany which he named <i>Psilotites filiformis</i>;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>Schimper<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> spoke of the specimens as too doubtful for determination,
    an opinion with which every botanist would cordially
    agree. Goldenberg’s species <i>Psilotites lithanthracis</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> from
    the Saarbrücken coal-field is founded on impressions of axes:
    some of these are dichotomously branched and bear small oval
    projections, which may be rudimentary leaves or possibly leaf-scars.
    More recently Kidston<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> described specimens of branched
    axes from the Lanarkshire coal-field bearing a row of lateral
    thorn-like projections under the title <i>Psilotites unilateralis</i>;
    but these fragments, as Dr Kidston himself admits, are of no
    botanical value.</p>

  <p>In a paper on fossil Salvinias, Hollick<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> mentions <i>Salvinia
    reticulata</i>, originally described by Heer and by Ettingshausen
    and <i>S. Alleni</i> Lesq.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> a Tertiary species, and calls attention to
    their very close resemblance in form, nervation, and apex to the
    leaves of the genus <i>Tmesipteris</i>: he refers both species to that
    genus. The drawings reproduced by Hollick represent leaves
    with a midrib and numerous anastomosing lateral veins,
    whereas in <i>Tmesipteris</i> the lamina of the leaf has a midrib
    without lateral branches. An enlarged drawing of the outlines
    of the epidermal cells would correspond closely with the small
    reticulations in the fossil leaves and it may be that there has
    been some confusion between veins and cell-outlines. In any
    case there would seem to be no reason for the use of the recent
    generic name<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

  <p>Among other fossils assigned to the Psilotales we have
    Marion’s genus <i>Gomphostrobus</i> from the Permian of France and
    Germany<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Marion placed this plant in the Coniferales on the
    strength of its resemblance to <i>Walchia</i> and <i>Araucaria</i>, but
    Potonié<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> is inclined to recognise in the leaves and monospermic
    sporophylls characters suggestive of Lycopodiaceous affinity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

  <p>The latter author in 1891<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, in ignorance of Marion’s proposal to
    adopt the name <i>Gomphostrobus</i>, instituted a genus <i>Psilotiphyllum</i>
    for the sporophylls of a species originally described by
    Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> as <i>Sigillariostrobus bifidus</i>, but he subsequently adopted
    Marion’s designation and with some hesitation included the
    French and German specimens in the Psilotales. As stated
    elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, Potonié’s arguments in favour of his view hardly
    carry conviction, and it is probably more in accordance with
    truth to deal with <i>Gomphostrobus</i> in the chapter devoted to
    the Coniferales.</p>

  <h4 id="Psilophyton"><i>Psilophyton.</i></h4>

  <p>The generic title <i>Psilophyton</i>, instituted by the late Sir
    William Dawson<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, has become familiar to geologists as that of
    a Pre-Carboniferous plant characteristic of Devonian and
    Silurian rocks in Canada, the United States of America, and
    Europe. From the botanist’s point of view the name stands
    for miscellaneous remains of plants of different types and in
    many cases unworthy of record. The genus was founded on
    impressions of branched axes from the Devonian strata of New
    Brunswick resembling the rachis and portions of lateral pinnae
    of ferns or the forked slender twigs of a Lycopod. The type-species
    <i>Psilophyton princeps</i> Daws. as represented on somewhat
    slender evidence in Dawson’s restoration, which accompanies the
    original description of the genus and has since been copied by
    several authors, is characterised by the possession of a horizontal
    rhizome bearing numerous rootlets and giving off dichotomously
    branched aerial shoots with spinous appendages, compared with
    rudimentary leaves, and terminating in slender branchlets
    bearing pendulous oval “spore-cases” from their tips. Some of
    the branchlets exhibit a fern-like vernation. The plant is
    spoken of by Dawson as apparently a generalised type<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, resembling
    in habit and in its rudimentary leaves the recent
    genus <i>Psilotum</i> and presenting points of contact with ferns.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>Specimens were found in an imperfectly petrified state showing
    a central cylinder of scalariform tracheae surrounded by a broad
    cortical zone of parenchyma and fibrous tissue.</p>

  <p>Among other species described by the author of the genus
    we need only mention <i>Psilophyton robustius</i>, characterised by
    vegetative shoots and “spore-cases” similar to those of the type-species;
    but, as Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> has pointed out, the petrified
    sections referred by Dawson to <i>P. robustius</i> are of an entirely
    different anatomical type from that of <i>P. princeps</i><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

  <p>British fossils from the Old Red Sandstone from the north
    of Scotland, Orkney and Caithness, originally figured by Hugh
    Miller and compared by him with algae but more especially
    with recent Lycopods, were subsequently placed by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
    in the genus <i>Psilophyton</i> as <i>P. Dechianum</i>, the specific designation
    being chosen on the ground that the Scotch specimens are
    specifically identical with fossils described by Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> as
    <i>Haliserites Dechianus</i>.</p>

  <p>Various opinions have been expressed in regard to the
    nature of the Devonian species <i>Haliserites Dechianus</i> Goepp.
    with which Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> identified Miller’s Old Red Sandstone
    plant: reference may be made to a paper by White<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> containing
    figures of dichotomously branched impressions described as
    species of <i>Thamnocladus</i> which he includes among the algae.</p>

  <p>In describing some Belgian impressions of Devonian age as
    <i>Lepidodendron gaspianum</i> Daws. Crépin<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> states that Carruthers
    has come to regard the specimens named by him <i>Psilophyton
    Dechianum</i> as branches of a Lepidodendron; he also quotes
    Carruthers as having expressed the opinion that the name
    <i>Psilophyton</i> had been employed by Dawson for two kinds of
    fossils, some being twigs of <i>Lepidodendron</i> while others, identified
    by Dawson as the reproductive branches of species
    of <i>Psilophyton</i>, represent the spore-cases of ferns comparable
    with Stur’s genus <i>Rhodea</i><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. One of the examples figured by
    Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> as <i>P. Dechianum</i> from Thurso (preserved in the
    British Museum, no. 52636), measuring 34 cm. in length and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>8 mm. broad, bears a close resemblance to a fern rhizome
    covered with ramental scales such as that of a species of
    <i>Davallia</i>. Other Belgian specimens described by Gilkinet<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> as
    <i>Lepidodendron burnotense</i>, like Crépin’s species, are no doubt
    generically identical with some of the Scotch and Canadian
    fossils placed in the genus <i>Psilophyton</i>, though Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
    considers that the species <i>Lycopodites Milleri</i> is more correctly
    referred to <i>Lycopodites</i> than to <i>Psilophyton</i>.</p>

  <p>A more recent paper on the Geology of the Perry basin in
    South-eastern Maine by Smith and White<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> contains a critical
    summary of the literature on <i>Psilophyton</i> and drawings of
    specimens. The latter afford good examples of Pre-Carboniferous
    plant fragments, such as are often met with in various parts
    of the world, which conform in habit to the New Brunswick
    specimens made by Dawson the type of his genus.</p>

  <p>An examination of material in the Montreal Museum and of
    Hugh Miller’s specimens in the Edinburgh collection leads me
    to share the opinion of Count Solms-Laubach that the name
    <i>Psilophyton</i> has been applied to plants which should not be
    included under one generic title. As Kidston<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> pointed out,
    the Canadian species <i>Psilophyton robustius</i> is not generically
    distinct from British and Belgian specimens referred to <i>Lepidodendron</i>;
    it may possibly be identical with the Bohemian plants
    on which Stur founded his genus <i>Hostinella</i><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The Devonian
    plants described by Stur have since been examined by Jahn<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
    who regards them as vascular plants, and not as algae to which
    Stur referred them; he mentions two species of <i>Psilophyton</i>
    but gives no figures.</p>

  <p>The “spore-cases” of Dawson may be found to be the
    microsporangia or perhaps the small seeds of some pteridosperm;
    the forked axes with a smooth surface and others
    figured by Miller and by Dawson, with the surface covered with
    scales suggesting the ramenta of a fern, may be the rachises or
    rhizomes of filicinean plants. Other specimens may be Lepidodendron
    twigs, as for example the petrified fragments figured by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>Dawson as <i>Psilophyton princeps</i>; while the stem identified as
    <i>P. robustius</i> is most probably that of a Gymnosperm. It is
    doubtful whether a useful purpose is served by retaining the
    genus <i>Psilophyton</i>. It was in the first instance instituted on
    the assumption, which cannot be upheld, that the abundant
    material in the New Brunswick beds bore a sufficiently close
    resemblance to the rhizome and aerial branches of <i>Psilotum</i>.
    <i>Psilophyton</i> has served as a name for miscellaneous plant
    fragments, many of which are indeterminable. Dr White
    concludes his account of the genus with the following words<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>:</p>

  <p>“The examination of such so-called Psilophyton material as
    I have seen shows the existence in America of two or more
    groups, represented by several fairly well-marked species which
    possess stratigraphical value, and which should be carefully
    diagnosed and illustrated. It is probable also that additional
    material throwing light on the structure and relationships of
    these very remarkable early types of land-plants will be
    discovered at some locality. The inspection of the material in
    hand emphasises the need, as was pointed out by Solms-Laubach,
    for the revision of the material referred by various
    authors to <i>Psilophyton</i>, together with a thorough re-examination
    and re-publication of the types.”</p>

  <p>Until a thorough re-examination has been made of the
    Canadian material, with a view to determine whether there
    exist substantial reasons for the retention of Dawson’s genus,
    it is undesirable to continue to make use of this name for Pre-Carboniferous
    fossils which are too incomplete to be assigned
    with certainty to a definite group of plants. Dr White draws
    attention to the similarity of some of the Perry basin specimens
    to Nathorst’s genus <i>Cephalotheca</i><a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> from Devonian rocks of Bear
    Island in the Arctic regions, a comparison which might be
    extended to other genera and which serves to illustrate the
    possibility that many of the specimens labelled <i>Psilophyton</i> may
    eventually be recognised as examples of well defined generic
    types belonging to more than one group of plants.</p>

  <h3 id="Recent_Lycopodiales">LYCOPODIALES.</h3>

  <p>The recent members of the Lycopodiales are considered
    apart from the extinct genera in order that our examination of
    the latter may be facilitated by a knowledge of the salient
    characteristics of the surviving types of this important section
    of the Pteridophyta. A general acquaintance with the extinct as
    well as with the recent genera will enable us to appreciate the
    contrasts between the living and the fossil forms and to realise
    the prominent position occupied by this group in the Palaeozoic
    period, a position in striking contrast to the part played by
    the diminutive survivors in the vegetation of the present day.
    In the account of the recent genera special attention is drawn
    to such features as afford a clue to the interpretation of the
    fossils, and the point of view adopted, which at times may
    appear to lead to an excessive attention to details, is necessarily
    somewhat different from that represented in botanical text-books<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The existing plants included in the Lycopodiales are in
    nearly all cases perennial herbaceous pteridophytes, exhibiting
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>in their life-histories a well marked alternation of generations.
    The sporophyte (asexual generation) is characterised by the
    relatively small size of the leaves except in the genus <i>Isoetes</i>
    (<a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>) and in the Australian and New Zealand genus
    <i>Phylloglossum</i>. The stems are usually erect or trailing, pendulous
    in epiphytic species or small and tuberous in <i>Isoetes</i>
    and <i>Phylloglossum</i>. The repeated forking of the shoots
    (monopodial and dichotomous branching) is a prominent feature
    of the group. The vascular tissue of the stem usually assumes
    the form of a single axial strand (stele) (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>), but the
    shoots of some species of <i>Selaginella</i> often contain two or more
    distinct steles (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>). The group as a whole is characterised
    by the centripetal development of the xylem composed almost
    entirely of scalariform tracheids: secondary xylem and phloem
    of a peculiar type occur in <i>Isoetes</i>, and the production of secondary
    xylem elements in a very slight degree has been noticed in one
    species of <i>Selaginella</i> (<i>S. spinosa</i>)<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. The roots are constructed on
    a simple plan, having in most cases only one strand of spiral
    protoxylem elements (monarch structure). In <i>Lycopodium</i>, in
    which stem and root anatomy are more nearly of the same type
    than in the majority of plants, several protoxylem strands may be
    present. The sporangia are axillary or, more frequently, borne
    on the upper surface of sporophylls, which are either identical
    with or more or less distinct from the foliage leaves; in the
    latter case the sporophylls often occur in the form of a well
    defined strobilus (cone) at the tips of branches.</p>

  <p>The gametophyte (sexual generation) is represented by
    prothalli which, in the homosporous genera, may live underground
    as saprophytes, or the upper portion may develop
    chlorophyll and project above the surface of the ground as an
    irregularly lobed green structure (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i>)<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.
    In the heterosporous forms the prothalli are much reduced and
    do not lead an independent existence outside the spore by the
    membrane of which they are always more or less enclosed. The
    sexual organs are represented by antheridia and archegonia;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>the male cells are provided with two cilia except in <i>Isoetes</i>
    which has multiciliate antherozoids like those of the ferns.</p>

  <p>The existing Lycopods, though widely distributed, never
    grow in sufficiently dense masses to the exclusion of other
    plants to form a conspicuous feature in the vegetation of a
    country. The inconspicuous rôle which they play among the
    plant-associations of the present era affords a striking contrast
    to the abundance of the arborescent species in the Palaeozoic
    forests of the northern hemisphere.</p>

  <p><b>Lycopodiaceae.</b> <i>Lycopodium</i>, represented by nearly 100
    species, forms a constituent of most floras: epiphytic species
    predominate in tropical regions, while others flourish on the
    mountains and moorlands of Britain and in other extra-tropical
    countries. For the most part <i>Lycopodium</i> exhibits a preference
    for a moist climate and appears to be well adapted to habitats
    where the amount of sunlight is relatively small and the
    conditions of life unfavourable for dense vegetation. Mountains
    and islands constantly recur as situations from which species
    have been recorded. Some species are essentially swamp-plants,
    <i>e.g.</i> <i>Lycopodium inundatum</i>, a British species, and
    <i>L. cruentum</i> from the marshes of Sierra Nevada. A variety
    of the American species, <i>L. alopecuroides</i> (var. <i>aquaticum</i>)
    affords an instance of a submerged form, which has been
    collected from an altitude of 12–14,000 ft. on the Andes and
    Himalayas. It is noteworthy that a considerable variety of
    habitats is represented within the limits of the genus and that
    many species are sufficiently hardy to exist in circumstances
    which would be intolerable to the majority of flowering plants<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

  <p>The British species frequently spoken of as Club Mosses,
    include <i>Lycopodium Selago</i>, <i>L. annotinum</i>, <i>L. clavatum</i>, <i>L. alpinum</i>,
    and <i>L. inundatum</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Selaginellaceae.</b> The species of <i>Selaginella</i>, over 300 in
    number, are widely spread in tropical and subtropical forests,
    growing on the ground with trailing, suberect or erect stems
    climbing over taller and stouter plants or as pendulous epiphytes
    on forest trees.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

  <p><i>Selaginella lepidophylla</i>, a tropical American type, popularly
    known as the Resurrection plant, and often erroneously spoken
    of as the Rose of Jericho<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, possesses the power of rolling up its
    shoots during periods of drought and furnishes an example of a
    species adapted to conditions in marked contrast to those which
    are most favourable to the majority of species.</p>

  <p>The only British species is <i>Selaginella spinosa</i> named
    by Linnaeus <i>Lycopodium selaginoides</i> and occasionally referred
    to as <i>Selaginella spinulosa</i> A. Br. (not to be confounded with a
    Javan species <i>S. spinulosa</i> Spring<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Isoetaceae.</b> <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>), of which Mr Baker in his
    <i>Handbook of the Fern-Allies</i> enumerates 49 species, is a
    type apart, differing in habit as in certain other characters from
    the other members of the Lycopodiales. Some botanists<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
    prefer to include the genus among the Filicales, but the balance
    of evidence, including resemblances between <i>Isoetes</i> and extinct
    Lycopodiaceous plants, would seem to favour its retention as an
    aberrant genus of the group Lycopodiales. Some species are
    permanently submerged, others occur in situations intermittently
    covered with water, and a few grow in damp soil.
    <i>Isoetes lacustris</i> is found in mountain tarns and lakes of Britain
    and elsewhere in Central and Northern Europe and North
    America. <i>Isoetes hystrix</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, a land-form occurs in Guernsey,
    North-East France, Spain and Asia Minor.</p>

  <h4 id="Lycopodiaceae">Lycopodiaceae.</h4>

  <p>The monotypic genus <i>Phylloglossum</i>, represented by <i>P.
    Drummondii</i> of Australia and New Zealand, though interesting
    from the point of view of its probable claim to be considered
    the most primitive type of existing Lycopodiaceous plants, need
    not be dealt with in detail. A complete individual, which
    does not exceed 4 or 5 cm. in length, consists of a very small
    tubercle or protocorm bearing a rosette of slender subulate
    leaves and prolonged distally as a simple naked axis which overtops
    the foliage leaves and terminates in a compact cluster of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>small scale-like sporophylls, each subtending a single sporangium<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Lycopodium.</i> It would be out of place in a volume devoted
    mainly to fossil plants to attempt a comprehensive account of
    the general morphology of recent species, and indeed our
    knowledge of the anatomical characters of the genus is still
    somewhat meagre. For purposes of comparison with extinct
    types, it is essential that some of the more important morphological
    features of existing species should be briefly considered.
    The additions made to our knowledge of the gameophyte<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
    of European and tropical species during the last two decades
    have revealed a striking diversity in habit.</p>

  <p>In several species, grouped round the widely distributed
    type <i>Lycopodium Selago</i> Linn., the comparatively short, erect or
    suberect, shoots form fairly compact tufts; the ordinary foliage-leaves
    function as sporophylls, and the sporangia are not localised
    on special portions of shoots. From this type, we pass to others
    in which the fertile leaves tend to be confined to the tips of
    branches, but hardly differ in form from the sterile. A further
    degree of specialisation is exhibited by species with well-defined
    cones composed of leaves (or bracts), the primary function of
    which is to bear sporangia and to afford a protective covering
    to the strobilus<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Lycopodium rufescens</i> Hook. An Andian species with stout
    dichotomously branched erect stems bears on the younger
    shoots crowded leaves with their thick and broadly triangular
    laminae pointing upwards, but on the older and thick shoots
    the laminae are strongly reflexed (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, A). The lower part
    of the specimen represented in <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, A, shows tangentially
    elongated scars and persistent leaf-bases or cushions
    left on the stem after the removal of the free portions of the
    leathery leaves, a surface-feature which also characterises the
    Palaeozoic genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The reflexed leaves and
    persistent leaf-cushions are clearly seen in the piece of old stem
    of <i>Lycopodium dichotomum</i> Jacq., a tropical American species
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>reproduced in <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, B. Such species as <i>L. erythraeum</i>
    Spring, and others with stiff lanceolate leaves exhibit a striking
    resemblance to the more slender shoots of some recent conifers,
    more especially <i>Araucaria excelsa</i>, <i>A. Balansae</i>, <i>Cryptomeria</i>,
    <i>Dacrydium</i> and other genera.</p>

  <p><i>L. squarrosum</i> Forst. (<a href="#fig122">fig. 122</a>) a tropical species from India,
    Polynesia, and other regions, is characterised by its stout stems
    reaching a diameter of 2·5 cm., bearing long pendulous branches

  <p><i>L. Dalhousianum</i> Spring, from the mountains of the Malay
    Peninsula and Borneo, has larger leaves of finer texture with a
    distinct midrib reaching a length of 2–3 cm. (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, E).
    Another type is illustrated by <i>L. nummularifolium</i> Blume, also
    a Malayan species, in which the leaves are shorter, broadly
    oblong or suborbicular, and the branches terminate in narrow
    and often very long strobili (sometimes reaching a length of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
    30 cm.) with small bracts in striking contrast to the foliage
    leaves (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, D). A similar form of long and slender
    strobilus occurs in <i>L. Phlegmaria</i> Linn., a common tropical
    Lycopod: the frequent forking of the strobili noticed in this
    and other species is a character not unknown among fossil cones
    (<i>Lepidostrobi</i>).</p>

  <p><i>L. cernuum</i> Linn. (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>), another widely spread tropical
    type, offers an even closer resemblance than <i>L. squarrosum</i> to
    the fossil Lepidodendra. The stiff erect stem, reaching in some
    cases a length of several feet, bears numerous repeatedly forked
    branches, with crowded linear leaves, terminating in short
    cylindrical cones with broadly ovate sporophylls. A similar
    habit characterises the North American species <i>L. obscurum</i>
    Linn. (<a href="#fig124">fig. 124</a>) bearing cones several centimetres in length.</p>

  <p><i>L. casuarinoides</i> Spring (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, F) an eastern tropical
    species, is worthy of notice as exhibiting a peculiar form of leaf
    consisting of a very small lamina, 3 mm. in length, borne on the
    top of a long decurrent base, which forms a narrow type of leaf-cushion,
    bearing some resemblance to the long and rib-like
    cushions of certain species of <i>Sigillaria</i>, and recalling the habit
    of slender fossil twigs referred to the Coniferae under such

    <i>Lycopodites falcatus</i> Lind. and Hutt. (<a href="#fig137">fig. 137</a>): it is also a
    representative of a few species of <i>Lycopodium</i> which agree
    with the majority of species of <i>Selaginella</i> in having two
    kinds of sterile leaves, comparatively long falcate leaves forming
    two lateral rows and smaller appressed leaves on the upper
    surface of the branches.</p>

  <p>These examples suffice to illustrate the general appearance
    presented by the vegetative shoots of recent species of which
    the foliage leaves vary considerably—from the small scale-leaves
    of <i>Lycopodium tetragonum</i>, to the very slender linear
    subulate leaves of such a species as <i>L. verticillatum</i> Linn. or the
    long and broader lamina of <i>L. Dalhousianum</i> (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, E). It is
    obvious that fragments of the various types preserved as fossils
    might well be mistaken either for some of the larger mosses or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
    for twigs of conifers. As Dr Bommer<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> has pointed out in his
    interesting paper on “Les causes d’erreur dans l’étude des
    empreintes végétales” some dicotyledonous plants may also
    simulate the habit of Lycopods: he cites <i>Phyllachne clavigera</i>
    Hook (Candolleaceae), <i>Tafalla graveolens</i> Wedd (Compositae)
    and <i>Lavoisiera lycopodioides</i> Gard. (Melastomataceae). Another
    point illustrated by <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a> is the close agreement in habit and
    in the form of the leaves and leaf-cushions between the recent
    plants and the Palaeozoic Lepidodendreae.</p>

  <p>In his masterly essay “On the vegetation of the Carboniferous
    Period, as compared with that of the present day” Sir
    Joseph Hooker called attention to the variation in the shape
    and arrangement of the leaves in the same species of <i>Lycopodium</i>.
    The three woodcuts which he publishes of <i>Lycopodium
    densum</i>, a New Zealand species, afford striking examples of the
    diversity in habit and leaf-form and justify his warning “that
    if the species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> were as prone to vary in the
    foliage as are those of <i>Lycopodium</i>, our available means for
    distinguishing them are wholly insufficient<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.”</p>

  <p>As we have already noticed, there is a considerable
    diversity among recent species, both as regards habitat and
    habit; in the anatomy of the stem also corresponding variations
    occur within the limits of a well-defined generic type of stele.
    In species with creeping stems, such as <i>L. clavatum</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, the
    stele exhibits an arrangement of vascular tissue characteristic
    of the plagiotropic forms. The xylem consists of more or less
    horizontal plates of scalariform tracheae, each surrounded by
    small-celled parenchyma, alternating with bands or groups of
    somewhat ill-defined phloem. The protoxylem and protophloem
    elements occupy an external position (exarch), pointing
    to a centripetal development of the metaxylem. This centripetal
    or root-like character of the primary xylem is an important
    feature in recent as in fossil Lycopods. The close agreement
    between the roots and stems of recent species in the disposition
    of the vascular elements also denotes a simpler type of anatomy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>than occurs in the majority of vascular plants in which stem
    and root have more pronounced structural peculiarities. A
    pericycle, 2–6 cells in breadth, encloses the xylem and phloem
    bands and this is succeeded by an endodermis, 2–3 cells broad,
    with vaguely defined limits. In <i>L. clavatum</i>, as in <i>L. alpinum</i>,
    another British species, the broad cortex is differentiated into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
    three fairly distinct regions; abutting on the endodermis is a
    zone several layers broad of thick-walled cells constituting an
    inner cortex modified for protection and support; the central
    region consists of larger and thinner-walled cells adapted for
    water-storage and aeration; beyond this is an outer cortical
    zone of firmer and thicker elements. The prominent leaf-bases
    or leaf-cushions (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, A, <i>lc</i>) give to the surface of a transverse
    section a characteristic appearance which presents the closest
    agreement with that of the younger shoots of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    From the peripheral protoxylem groups small strands of xylem
    are given off, which follow a steeply ascending course through
    the cortex to the single-veined leaves. The leaf-traces, in several
    species at least, are characterised by a mesarch structure
    (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, F, G), the spiral protoxylem elements occupying an
    approximately central position. The mesophyll of the leaves
    varies in regard to the extent of differentiation into a palisade
    and spongy parenchyma; in all cases there is a single vascular
    bundle occasionally accompanied by a secretory duct.</p>

  <p>In erect stems of <i>Lycopodium</i>, as represented by <i>L. cernuum</i>
    (figs. <a href="#fig123">123</a>, <a href="#fig125">125</a>, H, I), <i>L. Dalhousianum</i>, <i>L. squarrosum</i> (<a href="#fig122">fig. 122</a>)
    and many others, the stele presents a characteristic appearance
    due to the xylem plates being broken up into detached groups
    or short uniseriate bands with the interspaces occupied by
    phloem islands. This type of structure bears a superficial
    resemblance to that in the single stele of certain species of the
    fern <i>Lygodium</i><a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, but it is distinguished by the islands of phloem
    scattered through the stele. In other species the xylem tends
    to assume the form of a Maltese cross (<i>e.g.</i> <i>L. serratum</i> Thbg.)
    or it may be disposed as <b>V</b>-shaped and sinuous bands terminating
    in broad truncate ends composed of protoxylem elements.
    This form of the xylem and the distribution of the phloem
    groups are shown in <a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, D, E, drawn from a section of a
    plant of <i>Lycopodium saururus</i> Lam.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> collected by Mr A. W. Hill
    at an altitude of 15,000 feet on the Andes of Peru. The
    position of the protoxylem is shown <a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, E, <i>px</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p>While several species possess a cortex of three distinct zones
    (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, H, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>′, <i>c</i>″), in others the extra-stelar tissue is much
    more homogeneous, consisting of thin-walled parenchyma or in
    some cases of thick-walled elements; as a general rule, however,
    there is a tendency towards a more compact arrangement in the
    inner and outer portions of the cortex as contrasted with the
    larger and more loosely connected cells of the middle region.
    In certain types the middle cortex contains fairly large spaces,
    as in the swamp-species <i>L. inundatum</i>, which with <i>L. alopecuroides</i>
    exhibits another feature of some interest first described by
    Hegelmaier<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. If a transverse section of the stem of <i>L. inundatum</i>
    be examined the leaf-traces are seen to be accompanied by a
    circular canal containing mucilage which extends into the lamina
    of the leaf. In a specimen of <i>L. cernuum</i><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> obtained at a height
    of 2500 ft. by Professor Stanley Gardiner in the Fiji Islands,
    the leaf-traces (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, B <i>lt</i>) were found to be accompanied for
    part of their course by a well-marked secretory space (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>,
    B, <i>s</i>). There is little doubt that the presence of these mucilage
    canals is directly connected with a certain type of habitat<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and
    attention is called to them in view of a resemblance which they
    offer to a characteristic strand of tissue, known as the parichnos,
    which is associated with the leaf-traces of <i>Lepidodendreae</i> and
    <i>Sigillarieae</i>. In the section shown in <a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, H, the xylem
    of the stele forms more continuous bands than is often the case
    in <i>L. cernuum</i> which has already been described as having its
    xylem in small detached groups. The presence of the smaller
    branch-stele (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, H, <i>b</i>) affords an example of monopodial
    branching. The outer cortex of <i>L. saururus</i> (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, C)
    exhibits a somewhat unusual feature in the distribution of the
    thicker-walled tissue (<i>b</i>) which encloses a patch of more delicate
    parenchyma (<i>a</i>) with large lacunae (<i>lc</i>) in the region of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>leaf-bases, and presents the appearance of an irregular reticulum.
    This arrangement of the mechanical tissue in the outer cortex
    is comparable with that in stems of some species of <i>Sigillaria</i>.</p>

  <p>In certain species of <i>Lycopodium</i> the roots<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, which arise
    endogenously from the axial vascular cylinder, instead of
    passing through the cortex of the stem by the shortest route,
    bend downwards and bore their way in a more or less vertical
    direction before emerging at or near the base of the aerial
    shoot. The transverse section of <i>L. dichotomum</i> represented in
    <a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, A, shows several roots (R) in the cortex; they consist
    of a xylem strand of circular or crescentric form accompanied by
    phloem and enclosed by several layers of root-cortex. The roots
    of <i>Lycopodium</i> do not always present so simple a structure as
    those of <i>L. dichotomum</i>; the xylem may have an irregularly
    stellate form with as many as ten protoxylem groups.</p>

  <p><i>Reproductive Shoots<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</i> In <i>Lycopodium Selago</i> the foliage
    leaves serve also as sporophylls and, as Professor Bower<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has
    pointed out, the branches exhibit to some extent a zonal
    alternation of sterile and fertile leaves; in other species, in
    which foliage leaves and sporophylls are practically identical,
    the sporangia occur sporadically on the ordinary leaves. In
    species with well-defined terminal cones the lower sporophylls
    may bear arrested sporangia and thus form transitional stages
    between sterile and fertile leaves, a feature which occurs also
    in the male and female flowers of many recent Araucarieae<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
    The sporangia<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, D, F) are usually reniform and
    compressed in a direction parallel to the surface of the cone-scales;
    they are developed from the upper surface and close to
    the base of the fertile leaf to which they are attached by a
    short and thick stalk (<i>e.g.</i> <i>L. inundatum</i>) or by a longer and
    more slender pedicel (<i>L. Phlegmaria</i>, <a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, E). On maturity
    the sporangia open as two valves in the plane of compression
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>and the line of dehiscence is determined in some species at
    least by the occurrence of smaller cells in the wall. In
    transverse sections of cones in which the sporangia are strongly
    saddle-shaped, the sporophylls may appear to bear two sporangia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
    This is well shown in the section of a cone of <i>L. clavatum</i> shown
    in <a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, F. The sporangia <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are cut through in an
    approximately median plane showing the irregular outline of
    the sterile pad (<i>p</i>) of tissue in the sporogenous cavity. Those
    at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> have been traversed at a lower level and the two
    lobes of the saddle-shaped sporangia are cut below the attachment
    to the sporophyll. The distal laminae of the sporophylls, cut
    at different levels, are seen at the periphery of the cone.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In longitudinal radial section of some cones the sporangia
    appear to occupy an axillary position, but in others (<i>e.g.</i>
    <i>L. clavatum</i>) they are attached to the horizontal portion of the
    sporophyll almost midway between the axis of the cone and the
    upturned distal end of the sporophyll (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, D). The wall
    of a sporangium frequently consists of 2–3 cell-layers and in
    some cases (<i>e.g.</i> <i>L. dichotomum</i>), it may reach a thickness of seven
    layers, resembling in this respect the more bulky sporangia
    of a certain type of Lepidodendroid cone. The sporogenous
    tissue is separated from the stalk of the sporangium by a mass
    of parenchymatous tissue which may project as a prominent
    pad (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, D, F, <i>p</i>) into the interior of the sporogenous
    cavity. This basal tissue (the subarchesporial pad of Bower<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>)
    has been observed in <i>L. clavatum</i> to send up irregular processes
    of sterile cells among the developing spores, suggesting a
    comparison with the trabeculae which form a characteristic
    feature of the sporangia of <i>Isoetes</i> and with similar sterile
    strands noticed by Bower<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in <i>Lepidostrobus</i> (cone of <i>Lepidodendron</i>).</p>

  <p>Each sporophyll is supplied by a single vascular bundle
    which according to published statements never sends a branch
    to the sporangium base. The fertile tips of the foliage shoots
    of <i>L. cernuum</i> (<a href="#fig126">figs. 126</a>, A–C) afford good examples of
    specialised cones. The surface of the cone is covered by the
    broadly triangular laminae of sporophylls (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, C) which in
    their fimbriate margins resemble the Palaeozoic cone-scales
    described by Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> as <i>Lepidostrobus fimbriatus</i>. The
    distal portions of the sporophylls are prolonged downwards
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>(<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, A) to afford protection to the lower sporangia, their
    efficiency being increased by the lignified and thicker walls
    (A, <i>a</i>) of the cells in the lower portion of the laminar expansion.
    The cells of the sporangial wall are provided with strengthening
    bands which in surface-view (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, B) present the appearance
    of prominent pegs. Since the appearance of Miss Sykes’s
    paper on the sporangium-bearing organs of the Lycopodiaceae,
    Dr Lang<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> has published a more complete account of the
    structure of the strobilus of <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i> in which he
    records certain features of special interest. The importance of
    these morphological characters is increased by their agreement,
    as shown by Lang, with those of the Palaeozoic cone <i>Spencerites</i><a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.
    The sporophylls of a cone (12 mm. long by 3 mm. in diameter)
    of <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i> show an abrupt transition from the
    foliage leaves, but like these they occur in alternate whorls of five.
    A large sporangium is attached to the upper face of each sporophyll
    close to the base of the obliquely vertical distal lamina
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>(<a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>); each sporophyll, which is supplied with a single vascular
    bundle, has a large mucilage-cavity (<i>m</i>) in its lower region.
    “The mucilaginous change” in the sub-sporangial portion of
    a sporophyll “extends to the surface involving the epidermis, so
    that this portion of the sporophyll-base may be described as
    consisting of a mass of mucilage bounded below by a structureless
    membrane<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.” Dehiscence of the sporangia occurs at the middle
    of the distal face (<a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>, <i>x</i>). As seen in the radial section
    (<a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>, <i>ma</i>) the outer margin of the base of the sporophyll
    bears a short outgrowth. The leaf-bases of each whorl hang
    down between the sporangia of the alternating whorl below, and
    the base of each sporophyll is coherent with the margins of the
    two sporophylls of the next lower whorl between which it lies,
    the sporangia being thus closely packed and lying in a
    pocket “open only on the outer surface of the cone.” Fig. 128
    represents a transverse section through a cone in the plane AA
    of <a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>; this traverses the sporangia and their subtending
    bracts (<i>b</i>) of one whorl and the dependent bases of the
    sporophylls of the next higher whorl in the region of the
    mucilage-sacs (<i>m</i>), which are bounded at the periphery by the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>outer tissue of the sporophylls (<i>a</i>). A transverse section in the
    plane BB of <a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a> is shown in <a href="#fig129">fig. 129</a>: the pedicels and a
    part of each vascular strand are seen at <i>b</i> radiating from the
    axis of the cone; one sporophyll (<i>sp, a</i>) is cut through in the
    region of the pad of tracheal tissue that characterises the short
    sporangial stalks. The upper portions of the sporangia of the
    next lower whorl, which project upwards against the mucilaginous
    bases of the sporophylls above (cf. <a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>, BB) are shown
    at <i>c</i> and external to them, at <i>a</i>, the section has cut through
    the outer persistent portions of these sporophyll bases.</p>

  <p>As Lang points out, this highly complex structure is an
    expression of the complete protection afforded to the sporangia
    of a plant met with in exposed situations in the tropics; it
    is also of importance from a morphological standpoint as exhibiting
    an agreement with the extinct type of Lycopod cone
    represented by <i>Spencerites</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Selaginellaceae">Selaginellaceae.</h4>

  <p><i>Selaginella</i> differs from <i>Lycopodium</i> in the production of
    two kinds of spores, megaspores and microspores, and, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    great majority of species, in the dimorphic character of the
    foliage leaves, which are usually arranged in four rows, the
    laminae of the upper rows being very much smaller than those of
    the lower (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 1–3). The smaller leaves are shown more
    clearly in <a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 1<i>a</i>. It is obvious from an examination of a
    Selaginella shoot, such as is shown in <a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, that in fossil
    specimens it would often be almost impossible to recognise the
    existence of two kinds of leaves. Some species, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Selaginella
    spinosa</i><a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, the sole British representative of the genus, are
    homophyllous and agree in this respect with most species of
    <i>Lycopodium</i>. Another feature characteristic of <i>Selaginella</i>, as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>contrasted with <i>Lycopodium</i>, is the presence of a ligule in both
    foliage leaves and sporophylls. This is a colourless thin lamina
    attached by a comparatively stout foot to the base of a pit
    on the upper surface and close to the lower edge of the leaf
    (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 4, <i>l</i>; <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, E, F, <i>l</i>).</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 130. <i>Selaginella grandis.</i> (1–3, nat. size.)</div>

  <p>In an erect species, such as <i>S. grandis</i> Moore<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a> and
    <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, G) from Borneo, the main shoots, which may attain a
    height of 2–3 feet, bear small and inconspicuous leaves of
    one kind, but the lateral and repeatedly forked shoots are
    heterophyllous. The passage from the homophyllous to the
    heterophyllous arrangement is shown in the transition from the
    erect to the dorsiventral habit of the lateral shoots (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 2).
    The monopodially or dichotomously branched shoots produce
    long naked axes at the forks; these grow downwards to the
    ground where they develop numerous dichotomously forked
    branches. For certain reasons these naked aerial axes were
    named rhizophores and have always been styled shoots, the term
    root being restricted to repeatedly forked branches which the
    rhizophores produce in the soil. It has, however, been shown by
    Professor Harvey-Gibson<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that there is no sufficient reason for
    drawing any morphological distinction between rhizophores and
    roots, the term root being applicable to both.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the anatomy of <i>Selaginella</i>, thanks chiefly
    to the researches of Harvey-Gibson<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, is much more complete
    than in the case of <i>Lycopodium</i>. The stems, which may be
    either trailing or erect, are usually dorsiventral, and it is noteworthy
    that different shoots of the same plant or even the same
    axis in different regions may exhibit considerable variation in
    the structure and arrangement of the vascular tissue. In the
    well-known species, <i>Selaginella Martensii</i>, the stem, which is
    partly trailing, partly ascending, possesses a single ribbon-shaped
    stele composed of scalariform tracheids with two marginal
    protoxylems formed by the fusion of the leaf-traces of the
    dorsal and ventral leaves respectively. As in <i>Lycopodium</i> the
    metaxylem tracheae are as a rule scalariform, but reticulate
    xylem elements are by no means unknown. The tracheal band,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>surrounded by parenchymatous elements, is enclosed by phloem
    with external protophloem elements. The characteristic features
    of the stele are shown in the diagrammatic drawing of a section
    of another species—<i>S. Willdenowii</i>—represented in <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, A.</p>

  <p>A pericycle composed of one or two layers of chlorophyll-containing
    cells encircles the whole stele which is suspended
    in a lacuna by trabeculae (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, A, B, <i>t</i>) connecting the
    pericycle with the inner edge of the broad cortex. The
    trabeculae consist in part of endodermal cells characterised by
    cuticular bands. The cortex is usually differentiated into three
    fairly distinct regions. Mechanical tissue of thick-walled fibres
    constitutes the outer region (<i>a</i>); the middle cortex consists of
    thinner-walled parenchyma, the elements of which become
    smaller and rather more compactly arranged in the inner zone.
    The middle cortex is frequently characterised by the presence
    of spaces and by the hyphal or trabecular structure of the
    tissue, a feature which, as Bower<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> pointed out, is common to
    many recent and fossil members of the Lycopodiales. In some
    cases, <i>e.g.</i> <i>S. erythropus</i>, from tropical America, the cortex
    of the creeping stem consists entirely of thick-walled cells.
    <i>Selaginella grandis</i> (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>) has “a short decumbent stem
    rooted at close intervals<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,” from which thick erect aerial shoots
    rise to a height of one foot or more. In the apical region
    these erect axes give off repeatedly forked foliage shoots
    on which the spiral phyllotaxis of the homophyllous axis
    is gradually replaced by four rows of two kinds of leaves
    (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 2). The anatomy of this species agrees with that
    of <i>S. Martensii</i>. The trailing or semi-erect and homophyllous
    shoots of <i>Selaginella spinosa</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> present a distinct type of vascular
    anatomy. The upper part of the ascending stem has an axial
    strand of xylem with seven peripheral groups of spiral protoxylem
    tracheae (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, B); in the trailing portion of the
    shoot the protoxylem elements occur as one central group in
    the solid rod of metaxylem through which the leaf-traces pass
    on their way to the axial protoxylem. This type is important
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>as affording an exception, in the endarch structure of the
    xylem, to the usual exarch plan of the stelar tissues. This
    species is the only one in which any indication of the production
    of secondary xylem elements has so far been recorded.
    Bruchmann<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> has shown that, in the small tuberous swelling
    which occurs at the base of the young shoot (hypocotyl), a
    meristematic zone is formed round the axial vascular strand and
    by its activity a few secondary tracheids are added to the
    primary xylem. With this exception <i>Selaginella</i> appears to
    have lost the power of secondary thickening, the possession
    of which constitutes so striking a feature of the Palaeozoic
    Lycopods. Another type is represented by <i>S. inaequalifolia</i>,
    an Indian species, the shoots of which may have either a
    single stele or as many as five, each in its separate lacuna.
    The homophyllous <i>S. laevigata</i> var. <i>Lyallii</i> Spr., a Madagascan
    species, affords a further illustration of the variation in plan of
    the vascular tissues within the genus. There is a considerable
    difference in structure between the erect and creeping shoots;
    in the former there may be as many as 12–13 steles, which
    gradually coalesce before the vertical axis joins the creeping
    rhizome to form one central and four peripheral steles. In the
    rhizome there is usually a distinct axial stele without protoxylem,
    surrounded by an ill-defined lacuna and enclosed by a
    cylindrical stele (solenostele)<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> usually two tracheae in width
    with four protoxylem strands on its outer edge. The continuity
    of the tubular stele is broken and, in transverse section, it
    assumes the form of a horse-shoe close to the base of an erect
    shoot to which a crescentic vascular strand is given off.
    Harvey-Gibson<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> has figured a section of the rhizome of this
    type in which the axial vascular strand is represented by a
    slight ridge of tracheae (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, C, <i>t</i>) projecting towards the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>centre of the axis of the tubular stele. The cylindrical stele
    consists of xylem with external and internal phloem (<i>p</i>):
    cuticularised endodermal cells occur at <i>e</i> and <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>Reference has already been made to the descending naked
    branches given off from the points of ramification of the foliage
    shoots of <i>Selaginella</i>. It has been shown by Harvey-Gibson<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
    that these branches, originally designated rhizophores by
    Nägeli and Leitgeb, as well as the dichotomously branched
    roots which they produce below the level of the ground,
    possess a single vascular strand of monarch type. It is interesting
    to find that in some species the aerial portion of the
    rhizophore has a xylem strand with a central protoxylem,
    an instance of endarch structure like that in certain portions
    of the shoot-system of <i>S. spinosa</i>. The root-anatomy of
    <i>Selaginella</i> and the dichotomous habit of branching afford
    points of agreement with the subterranean organs of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and <i>Sigillaria</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Leaves.</i> The leaves of <i>Selaginella</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> usually consist of a
    reticulum of loosely arranged cells, but in some cases part of
    the mesophyll assumes the palisade form. The single vascular
    bundle consists of a few small annular or spiral tracheae and at
    the apex of the lamina the protoxylem elements are accompanied
    by several short reticulated pitted elements. Both foliage
    leaves and sporophylls are characterised by the possession of a
    ligule, a structure which may present the appearance of a
    somewhat rectangular plate (<a href="#fig130">fig. 130</a>, 4, <i>l</i>, and <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, E–G, <i>l</i>)
    or assume a fan-shaped form with a lobed or papillate margin.
    The base, composed of large cells, is sunk in the tissue of the
    leaf close to its insertion on the stem (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, E, <i>l</i>) and
    enclosed by a well-marked parenchymatous sheath. The
    sheath is separated from the vascular bundle of the leaf by one
    or more layers of cells, and in some species these become transformed
    into short tracheids. The ligule is regarded by Harvey-Gibson<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
    as a specialised ramentum which serves the temporary
    function of keeping moist the growing-point and young leaves.</p>

  <p><i>Cones.</i> The terminal portions of the branches of <i>Selaginella</i>
    usually bear smaller leaves of uniform size which function as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>sporophylls, but in this genus the fertile shoots do not generally
    form such distinct cones as in many species of <i>Lycopodium</i>.
    In <i>S. grandis</i> (figs. <a href="#fig130">130</a>, 3; <a href="#fig122">131</a>, G) the long and narrow strobili
    consist of a slender axis bearing imbricate sporophylls in four
    rows: each sporophyll subtends a sporangium situated between
    the ligule and the axis of the shoot. The sporangium may be
    developed from the axis of the cone or, as in <i>Lycopodium</i>, from
    the cells of the sporophyll<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. In some species the lower sporophylls
    bear only megasporangia, each normally containing four
    megaspores, the microsporangia being confined to the upper
    part of the cone. This distribution of the two kinds of sporangia
    is, however, by no means constant<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>: in some cases, <i>e.g.</i> <i>S.
    rupestris</i>, cones may bear megasporangia only, and in the cone
    of <i>S. grandis</i>, of which a small piece is represented in <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, G,
    all the sporangia were found to contain microspores.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of two kinds of spores in <i>Selaginella</i>
    constitutes a feature of special importance from the point of
    view of the relationship between the Phanerogams, in which
    heterospory is a constant character, and the heterosporous
    Pteridophytes. One of the most striking distinctions between
    the Phanerogams and the rest of the vegetable kingdom lies in
    the production of seeds. Recent work has, however, shown that
    seed-production can no longer be regarded as a distinguishing
    feature of the Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. Palaeozoic
    plants which combined filicinean and cycadean features resembled
    the existing Phanerogams in the possession of highly
    specialised seeds. This discovery adds point to the comparison
    of the true seed with structures concerned with reproduction in
    seedless plants, which in the course of evolution gave rise to the
    more efficient arrangement for the nursing, protection, and
    ultimate dispersal of the embryo. In the megaspore of
    <i>Selaginella</i> we have, as Hofmeister was the first to recognise
    in 1851, a structure homologous with the embryo-sac of the
    Phanerogam. The embryo-sac consists of a large cell produced
    in a mass of parenchymatous tissue known as the nucellus
    which is almost completely enclosed by one or more integuments.
    Fertilisation of the egg-cell within the embryo-sac
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>takes place as a rule while the female reproductive organ is
    still attached to the parent-plant and separation does not occur
    until the ovule has become the seed.</p>

  <p>In a few cases, notably in certain plants characteristic of
    Mangrove swamps, continuity between the seed and its parent
    is retained until after germination. The megasporangium of
    <i>Selaginella</i> dehisces<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> along a line marked out by the occurrence
    of smaller cells over the crest of the wall. It has been customary
    to describe the megaspores as being fertilised after ejection
    from the sporangia. This earlier separation from the parent
    and the absence of any protective covering external to the
    spore-wall constitute two distinguishing features between seeds
    and megaspores. In <i>Selaginella apus</i>, a Californian species,
    Miss Lyon has shown that fertilisation of the egg-cell usually
    takes place while the megaspore is still in the strobilus. On
    examining withered decayed strobili of this species which
    had been partially covered with the soil for some months after
    fertilisation of the megaspores, several young plants were
    found with cotyledons and roots projecting through the crevices
    of the megasporangia<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. From this, adds Miss Lyon, “it seems
    safe to assume that an embryo may have two periods of
    growth separated by one of quiescence quite comparable to
    those of seed plants with marked xerophilous features.”</p>

  <p>In another Western American species <i>S. rupestris</i> described
    by the same writer the cotyledons of young plants were found
    protruding from the imbricate sporophylls of a withered cone
    (<a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, D). This species is interesting also from the
    occasional occurrence of one instead of four megasporangia in a
    sporangium; a condition which affords another connecting link
    between the heterosporous Pteridophytes, on the one hand, and
    the seed-bearing Phanerogams in which the occurrence of a
    single embryo-sac (megaspore) in each ovule is the rule. The
    cones of <i>Selaginella rupestris</i> retain connexion with the plant
    through the winter and fertilisation occurs in the following
    spring. After the embryo has been formed the megasporangium
    “becomes sunken in a shallow pit formed by the cushion-like
    outgrowth of the sporophyll around the pedicel.” It is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>suggested that this outgrowth may be comparable with the
    integument which grows up from the sporophyll in the fossil
    genus <i>Lepidocarpon</i><a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and almost completely encloses the
    sporangium. In the drawings given by Miss Lyon no features
    are recognisable which afford a parallel to the integument
    of <i>Lepidocarpon</i>. I have, however, endeavoured to show, by a
    brief reference to this author’s interesting account of the two
    Californian species, that the physiological and morphological
    resemblances between the megasporangia of <i>Selaginella</i> and the
    integumented ovules of the seed-bearing plants are sufficiently
    close to enable us to recognise possible lines of advance towards
    the development of the true seed.</p>

  <p>Professor Campbell<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> records an additional example of a
    <i>Selaginella</i>—probably <i>S. Bigelovii</i>—from the dry region of
    Southern California in which the spores become completely
    dried up after the embryo has attained some size, remaining in
    that state until the more favourable conditions succeeding the
    dry season induce renewed activity.</p>

  <h4 id="Isoetaceae">Isoetaceae.</h4>

  <p>The genus <i>Isoetes</i> is peculiar among Pteridophytes both in
    habit and in anatomical features. In its short and relatively
    thick tuberous stem, terminating in a crowded rosette of
    subulate leaves like those of <i>Juncus</i> and bearing numerous
    adventitious roots, <i>Isoetes</i> presents an appearance similar to
    that of many monocotyledonous plants. The habit of the
    genus is well represented by such species as <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>
    and <i>I. echinospora</i><a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> (<a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>) both of which grow in freshwater
    lakes in Britain and in other north European countries.
    The latter species bears leaves reaching a length of 18 cm.
    The resemblance in habit between this isolated member of
    the Pteridophytes and certain Flowering plants, although in
    itself of no morphological significance, is consistent with the
    view expressed by Campbell that <i>Isoetes</i> may be directly related
    to the Monocotyledons<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

  <p>There is as a rule little or no difference between the foliage
    leaves and sporophylls; in <i>I. lacustris</i> the latter are rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
    larger and in the terrestrial species <i>I. hystrix</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> the sterile leaves
    are represented by the expanded basal portions only, which
    persist like the leaf-bases of <i>Lepidodendron</i> as dark brown
    scales to form a protective investment to the older part of the
    stem. The innermost leaves are usually sterile; next to these
    are sporophylls bearing megasporangia, and on the outside are
    the older sporophylls with microsporangia. The long and
    slender portion of the leaf becomes suddenly expanded close
    to its attachment to the stem into a broad base of crescentic
    section which bears a fairly conspicuous ligule (figs. <a href="#fig132">132</a>, B, <i>l</i>,
    <a href="#fig133">133</a>, E, <i>l</i>) inserted by a foot or glossopodium in a pit near the
    upper part of the concave inner face. The ligule is usually
    larger than that of <i>Selaginella</i>, though of the same type. The
    free awl-like lamina contains four large canals bridged across at
    intervals by transverse diaphragms, and in the axial region a
    single vascular bundle of collateral structure. Other vascular
    elements, in the form of numerous short tracheids occur below
    the base of the transversely elongated ligule.</p>

  <p>Stomata are found on the leaves of <i>I. hystrix</i>, <i>I. Boryana</i><a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>,
    and in other species which are not permanently submerged.
    Both microsporangia and megasporangia are characterised by
    their large size and by the presence of trabeculae or strands of
    sterile tissue (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E, H, <i>t</i>) completely bridging across the
    sporangial cavity or extending as irregular ingrowths among the
    spore-producing tissue. Similar sterile bands, though less
    abundant and smaller, are occasionally met with in the still
    larger sporangia of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>; these may be regarded as a
    further development of the prominent pad of cells which
    projects into the sporangial cavity in recent species of
    <i>Lycopodium</i> (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, D, <i>p</i>). The sporangia are attached by a
    very short stalk to the base of a large depression in the leaf-base
    below the ligule, from the pit of which they are separated
    by a ridge of tissue known as the saddle, and from this ridge a
    veil of tissue (the velum) extends as a roof over the sporangial
    chamber (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E, <i>v</i>). In most species there is a large gap
    between the lower edge of the velum and that of the sporangial
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>pit, but in <i>I. hystrix</i> this protective membrane is separated
    from the base of the leaf by a narrow opening, the resemblance
    of which to the micropyle of an ovule suggested to one of the
    older botanists the employment of the same term<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. Mr T. G.
    Hill<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> has called attention to the presence of mucilage canals in
    the base of the sporophylls of <i>I. hystrix</i>, which he compares with
    the strands of tissue known as the parichnos accompanying the
    leaf-traces of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i> in the outer cortex
    of the stem. The transverse section shown in <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, H and I,
    shows two of these mucilage canals in an early stage of
    development; a strand of parenchymatous elements distinguished
    by their partially disorganised condition and more
    deeply stained membranes (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, I) runs through the
    spandrels of the sporophyll tissue close to the upper surface.
    There is a close resemblance between the structure of these
    partially formed mucilage-canals and the tissue which has been
    called the secretory zone in Lepidodendron stems. Fig. 133, H,
    also shows a large microsporangium with prominent trabeculae
    (<i>t</i>) lying below the velum. A longitudinal section (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E)
    through a sporophyll-base presents an appearance comparable
    with that of an Araucarian cone-scale with its integumented
    ovule and micropyle. The megaspores are characterised by
    ridges, spines, and other surface-ornamentation<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. Though usually
    unbranched, the perennial stem of <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>) has in rare
    cases been found to exhibit dichotomous branching, a feature, as
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> points out, consistent with a Lycopodiaceous
    affinity. The apex is situated at the base of a funnel-shaped
    depression. The stem is always grooved; in some species two
    and in others three deep furrows extend from the base up the sides
    of the short and thick axis towards the leaves: from the sides of
    these furrows numerous slender roots are given off in acropetal
    succession. A stele of peculiar structure occupies the centre of
    the stem; cylindrical in the upper part (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A), it assumes
    a narrow elliptical or, in species in which there are three furrows,
    a triangular form in the lower portion of the tuberous stem.</p>

  <p>The primary vascular cylinder<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> consists of numerous spiral,
    annular or reticulate tracheids (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>x</i>) which are either
    isodiametric or longer in a horizontal than in a vertical
    direction, associated with parenchyma. Lower in the stem
    crushed and disorganised xylem elements are scattered through
    a still living trabecular network of parenchymatous tissue.
    From the axial cylinder numerous leaf-traces (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>lt</i>)
    radiate outwards, at first in a horizontal direction and then
    gradually ascending towards the leaves. The vascular cylinder
    is of the type known as cauline; that is, some of the xylem is
    distinct in origin from that which consists solely of the lower
    ends of leaf-traces. As in <i>Lycopodium</i> the development of the
    metaxylem is centripetal.</p>

  <p>Von Mohl<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, and a few years later Hofmeister<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, were the first
    botanists to give a satisfactory account of the anatomy of
    <i>Isoetes</i> but it is only recently<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> that fresh light has been thrown
    upon the structural features of the genus the interest of which
    is enhanced by the many points of resemblance between the
    recent type and the Palaeozoic Lepidodendreae. A striking
    anatomical feature is the power of the stem to produce secondary
    vascular and non-vascular tissue; the genus is also characterised
    by the early appearance of secondary meristematic
    activity which renders it practically impossible to draw any
    distinct line between primary and secondary growth. A
    cylinder of thin-walled tissue (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>a</i>) surrounds
    the primary central cylinder and in this a cambial zone, <i>c</i>, is
    recognised even close to the stem-apex; this zone of dividing
    cells is separated from the xylem by a few layers of rectangular
    cells to which the term prismatic zone has been applied.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>The early appearance of the cambial activity on the edge of the
    vascular cylinder is shown in <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, C, which represents part
    of a transverse section of a young stem. A leaf-trace, <i>lt</i>, is in
    connexion with the primary xylem, <i>x′</i>, which consists of short
    tracheids, often represented only by their spiral or reticulately
    thickened bands of lignified wall, and scattered parenchyma.
    Some of the radially elongated cells on the sides of the leaf-trace
    are seen to be in continuity on the outer edge of the
    stele, at <i>st</i>, with flattened elements, some of which are sieve-tubes.
    The position of a second leaf-trace is shown at <i>lt′</i>.
    External to the sieve-tubes the tissue consists of radially
    arranged series of rectangular cells, some of which have already
    assumed the function of a cambium (<i>c</i>). The tissue produced
    by the cambium on its inner edge consists of a varying amount
    of secondary xylem composed of very short spiral tracheids;
    a few of these may be lignified (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>) while others
    remain thin.</p>

  <p>Phloem elements, recognisable by the presence of a thickened
    reticulum enclosing small sieve-areas (fig 133, B, <i>s</i>) are fairly
    abundant, and for the rest this intracambial region is composed
    of thin-walled parenchyma. In longitudinal section these
    tissues present an appearance almost identical with that
    observed in a transverse section. Fig. 133, B represents a
    longitudinal section, through the intracambial zone and the
    edge of the stele, of a younger stem than that shown in
    <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A. Most of the radially disposed cells internal to the
    meristematic region are parenchymatous without any distinctive
    features; a few scattered sieve-tubes (<i>s</i>) are recognised by their
    elliptical sieve-areas and an occasional tracheid can be detected.
    The cambium cuts off externally a succession of segments
    which constitute additional cortical tissue (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>cr</i>)
    of homogeneous structure, composed of parenchymatous cells
    containing starch and rich in intercellular spaces. As the stem
    grows in thickness the secondary cortex reaches a considerable
    breadth and the superficial layers are from time to time
    exfoliated as strips of dead and crushed tissue (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, <i>b</i>).
    The diagrammatic sketch reproduced in <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, A, serves to
    illustrate the arrangement and relative size of the tissue-regions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
    in an <i>Isoetes</i> stem. In the centre occur numerous spirally or
    reticulate tracheae scattered in parenchymatous tissue which
    has been considerably stretched and torn in the peripheral
    region of the stele; the radiating lines mark the position of the
    leaf-traces (<i>lt</i>) in the more horizontal part of their course. The
    zone between the cambium (<i>c</i>) and the edge of the central
    cylinder consists of radially disposed secondary tissue of short,
    and for the most part unlignified, elements including sieve-tubes
    and parenchyma; the secondary xylem elements consist
    largely of thin-walled rectangular cells with delicate spiral
    bands, but discontinuous rows of lignified tracheae (<i>x<sup>2</sup></i>) occur
    in certain regions of the intracambial zone. The rest of the
    stem consists of secondary cortex (<i>cr</i>) with patches of dead
    tissue (<i>b</i>) still adhering to the irregularly furrowed surface.
    The structure of the cambium and its products is shown in
    the detailed drawing reproduced in <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, D. Many of the
    elements cut off on the inner side of the cambium exhibit the
    characters of tracheids: most of these are unlignified, but others
    have thicker and lignified walls (<i>tr</i>).</p>

  <p><i>I. hystrix</i> appears to be exceptional in retaining its leaf-bases,
    which form a complete protective investment and prevent
    the exfoliation of dead cortex. Each leaf-trace consists of a few
    spiral tracheids accompanied by narrow phloem elements directly
    continuous with the secondary phloem of the intracambial zone.
    Dr Scott and Mr Hill have pointed out that a normal cambium
    is occasionally present in the stem of <i>I. hystrix</i> during the early
    stages of growth; this gives rise to xylem internally. The
    few phloem elements observed external to the cambium may be
    regarded as primary phloem, a tissue not usually represented in
    an Isoetes stem<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. The occasional occurrence of this normal
    cambium, may, as Scott and Hill suggest, be a survival from a
    former condition in which the secondary thickening followed
    a less peculiar course. The lower leaf-traces become more or
    less obliterated as the result of the constant increase in thickness
    of the broad zone of secondary tissues through which they pass.</p>

  <p>The adventitious roots are developed acropetally and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>arranged in parallel series on each side of the median line of the
    two or three furrows. The three arms of the triangular stele of
    <i>I. hystrix</i> and the two narrow ends of the long axis of the stele
    of <i>I. lacustris</i>, which in transverse section has the form of a
    flattened ellipse, are built up of successive root-bases. A root
    of <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, G) possesses one vascular bundle, <i>x</i>, with a
    single strand of protoxylem, <i>px</i>, thus agreeing in its monarch
    structure with the root-bundle in <i>Selaginella</i> and many species
    of <i>Lycopodium</i>. The cortical region of the root consists of a few
    layers of outer cortex succeeded by a large space, formed by
    the breaking down of the inner cortical tissue, into which the
    vascular bundle projects (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, F). The peculiarity of the
    roots in having a hollow cortex and an eccentric vascular bundle
    was noticed by Von Mohl<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. In the monarch bundles, as in the
    fistular cortex and dichotomous branching, the roots of <i>Isoetes</i>
    present a striking resemblance to the slender rootlets of the
    Palaeozoic <i>Stigmaria</i> (see <a href="#Page_246">page 246</a>). The longitudinal section
    through the base of a root of <i>Isoetes lacustris</i> shown in <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, F,
    affords a further illustration of certain features common to the
    fossil and recent types.</p>

  <h3 id="Fossil_Lycopodiales">FOSSIL LYCOPODIALES.</h3>

  <h4>Isoetaceae</h4>

  <p>The geological history of this division of the Pteridophyta is
    exceedingly meagre, a fact all the more regrettable as it is by
    no means improbable that in the surviving genus <i>Isoetes</i> we
    have an isolated type possibly of considerable antiquity and
    closely akin to such extinct genera as <i>Pleuromeia</i> and
    <i>Sigillaria</i>. If Saporta’s Lower Cretaceous species <i>Isoetes
    Choffati<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></i>, or more appropriately <i>Isoetites Choffati</i>, is correctly
    determined, it is the oldest fossil member of the family and
    indeed the most satisfactory among the more than doubtful
    species described as extinct forms of <i>Isoetes</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <h4>Isoetites.</h4>

  <p>The generic name <i>Isoetites</i> was first used by Münster<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in the
    description of a specimen, from the Jurassic lithographic slates
    of Solenhofen in Bavaria, which he named <i>Isoetites crociformis</i>.
    The specific name was chosen to express a resemblance of the
    tuberous appearance of the lower part of the imperfectly preserved
    and indeterminable fossil to a Crocus corm.</p>

  <p>Impressions of Isoetes-like leaves from the Inferior Oolite
    of Yorkshire figured by Phillips<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and afterwards by Lindley<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> as
    <i>Solenites Murrayana</i> were compared by the latter author with
    <i>Isoetes</i> and <i>Pilularia</i>, but these leaves are now generally
    assigned to Heer’s gymnospermous genus <i>Czekanowskia</i>. An
    examination of the structure of the epidermal cells of these
    Jurassic impressions convinced me that they resemble recent
    coniferous needles more closely than the leaves of any Pteridophyte.
    The genus <i>Czekanowskia<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></i> is recognised by several
    authors as a probable member of the Ginkgoales.</p>

  <h5><i>Isoetites Choffati.</i> Saporta.</h5>

  <p>The late Marquis of Saporta founded this species on two
    sets of impressions from the Urgonian (Lower Cretaceous) of
    Portugal which, though not found in actual organic connexion,
    may possibly be portions of the same plant. Small relatively
    broad tuberous bodies reaching a breadth of 1 cm. are compared
    with the short and broad stem of <i>Isoetes</i>, which they resemble
    in bearing numerous appendages radiating from the surface like
    the roots of the recent species; on the exposed face of the stem
    occur scattered circular scars representing the position of roots
    which were detached before fossilisation. Other impressions
    are identified as the basal portions of sporophylls bearing
    sporangia: these suggest the expanded base of the fertile leaves
    of <i>Isoetes</i> with vertically elongated sporangia, some of which
    have a smooth surface while in others traces of internal structure
    are exposed; the interior consists of an irregular network with
    depressions containing carbonised remains of spores.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>While recognising a general resemblance to the sporophylls
    of <i>Isoetes</i>, certain differences are obvious: there is no ligule in
    the fossil leaves nor are there any distinct traces of vascular
    strands such as occur in the leaves of recent species. The
    form of the sporangium, more elongated than in the majority
    of recent forms, is compared by Saporta with that in a south
    European species <i>Isoetes setacea</i> Spr.</p>

  <p>Such evidence as we have lends support to the inclusion of
    these Portuguese fossils in the genus <i>Isoetites</i>, but apart from
    the fact that we have no proof of any connexion between the
    stems and supposed sporophylls, the resemblance of the latter
    to those of <i>Isoetes</i> is, perhaps, hardly sufficient to satisfy all
    reasonable scepticism.</p>

  <p>The generic name <i>Isoetopsis</i> was used by Saporta as more
    appropriate than <i>Isoetes</i> for some Eocene fossils from Aix-en-Provence
    which are too doubtful to rank as trustworthy evidence
    of the existence of the recent genus. The species, <i>Isoetopsis
    subaphylla</i><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> is founded on impressions of small scales, 4 mm.
    long, bearing circular bodies which are compared with sporangia
    or spores.</p>

  <p>Other records of fossils referred to <i>Isoetes</i> need not be
    described as they have no claim to be regarded as contributions
    towards the past history of the genus. Heer’s Miocene species
    <i>Isoetites Scheuzeri</i> and <i>I. Braunii</i> Unger<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> from Switzerland are
    based on unsatisfactory material and are of no importance.</p>

  <h4 id="Pleuromeia">Pleuromeia.</h4>

  <p>The generic name <i>Pleuromeia</i>, was suggested by Corda<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> for
    a fossil from the Bunter Sandstone, the original description of
    which was based by Münster<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> on a specimen discovered in a
    split stone from the tower of Magdeburg Cathedral.</p>

  <p>The majority of the specimens have been obtained from the
    neighbourhood of Bernburg, but a few examples are recorded
    from Commern and other German localities: all are now included
    under the name <i>Pleuromeia Sternbergi</i>. Germar, who published
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>one of the earlier accounts of the species, states that Corda
    dissented from Münster’s choice of the name <i>Sigillaria</i> and
    proposed the new generic title <i>Pleuromeia</i>. One of the best
    descriptions of the genus we owe to Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> whose
    paper contains references to earlier writers. Illustrations have
    been published by Münster, Germar<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, Bischof<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, Solms-Laubach
    and Potonié<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Pleuromeia Sternbergi</i> is represented by casts of vegetative
    and fertile axes, but the preservation of the latter is not
    sufficiently good to enable us to draw any very definite
    conclusions as to the nature of the reproductive organs. Casts
    of the stems reach a length of about 1 metre and a diameter of
    5–6 cm., or in some cases 10 cm.; all of them are in a more
    or less decorticated state, the degree of decortication being
    responsible for differences in the external features which led
    Spieker<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> to adopt more than one specific name.</p>

  <p><a href="#fig134">Fig. 134</a>, A, represents a sketch, made some years ago, of a
    specimen in the Breslau Museum which contains several examples
    of this species, among others those described by Germar in
    1852. The cylindrical cast (38 cm. long by 12 cm. in circumference),
    which has been slightly squeezed towards the upper
    end, bears spirally arranged imperfectly preserved leaf-scars and
    the lower end shows the truncated base of one of the short
    Stigmaria-like arms characteristic of the plant. As shown
    clearly in a specimen originally figured by Bischof and more
    recently by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, the stem-base is divided by a double
    dichotomy into four short and broad lobes with blunt apices and
    bent upwards like the arms of a grappling iron (<a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, D).
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>The surface of this basal region is characterised by numerous
    circular scars (<a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, D; 4 scars enlarged) in the form of
    slightly projecting areas with a depression in the centre of
    each. These are undoubtedly the scars of rootlets, remains of
    which are occasionally seen radiating through the surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
    rock. As seen in <a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, D, <i>a</i>, the fractured surface of a
    basal area may reveal the existence of an axial vascular cylinder
    giving off slender branches to the rootlets.</p>

  <p>The bulbous enlargement at the base of the Brown seaweed
    <i>Laminaria bulbosa</i> Lam.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> simulates the swollen base of
    <i>Pleuromeia</i>; but a confusion between these two plants is hardly
    likely to occur. Above the Stigmaria-like base the gradually
    tapered axis, in the less decorticated specimens, bears spirally
    disposed transversely elongated areas consisting of two triangular
    scars between which is the point of exit of a leaf-trace.
    The form of the leaf-scars is best seen on the face of a mould
    figured by Solms-Laubach (<a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, C): in this case the two
    triangular areas appear as slight projections separated by a
    narrow groove marking the position of the vascular bundle of
    the leaf. The curved lines above and below the leaf-scar
    probably mark the boundary of the leaf-base. The two
    triangular scars are compared by Solms-Laubach and by
    Potonié with the parichnos-scars of <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    (cf. <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, C), but the large size of the Pleuromeia
    scars constitutes an obvious difference though possibly not a
    distinction of importance.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of a vertical canal filled with carbonaceous
    material in some of the stems throws light on the internal
    structure: the canal, which is described by Solms-Laubach as
    having a stellate outline in transverse section recalls the narrow
    central cylinder of a Lepidodendron stem, and this comparison
    is strengthened by the presence of obliquely ascending grooves
    which represent leaf-traces passing through the cortex. In
    specimens which have lost more of the cortical tissues the
    surface is characterised by spirally disposed, discontinuous
    vertical grooves representing portions of leaf-traces precisely as
    they appear in similar casts of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. There is no
    direct evidence of the existence of secondary wood in the stem,
    but, as Potonié has pointed out, the greater transverse elongation
    of the leaf-scars in the lower part of a cast (<a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, A) points
    to the production of some secondary tissue either in the
    vascular cylinder or cortex, or possibly in both regions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

  <p>In some specimens of <i>Pleuromeia</i> the upper portion is
    clothed with crowded and imbricate sporophylls which reach a
    length of 2·5 cm., a maximum breadth of 2·7 cm., and a thickness
    of 1 mm. Each sporophyll has a thin wing-like border, and
    on the lower face are several parallel lines. Solms-Laubach
    describes the sporangium or ovule as attached to the lower
    surface of the sporophyll and this opinion has been confirmed by
    Fitting<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> who has also brought forward satisfactory evidence in
    favour of the sporangial nature of the reproductive organs.
    Fitting found numerous spores in the Bunter Sandstone near
    Halle; these are flattened circular bodies 0·5–0·7 mm. in diameter
    with a granulated surface and the three converging lines
    characteristic of spores produced in tetrads. The comparison
    made by this author between the sporophylls of <i>Pleuromeia</i>,
    which bore the sporangia on the lower surface instead of on the
    upper as in other lycopodiaceous plants, and the pollen-sacs of
    Conifers, is worthy of note in reference to the possible relationship
    between Conifers and Lycopods.</p>

  <p>A comparison of the <i>Isoetes</i> stem represented in <a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>, A,
    with the base of a <i>Pleuromeia</i> shows a striking similarity, but,
    as Fitting points out, the Stigmaria-like arms of the fossil contained
    a vascular cylinder whereas the blunt lobes of <i>Isoetes</i>
    consist exclusively of cortical tissue, the roots being given off
    from the grooves between the lobes of the tuberous stem.</p>

  <p>The position of <i>Pleuromeia</i> must for the present be left an
    open question; it is, however, clear that the plant bears a close
    resemblance in the form of its base to the Stigmarian branches
    of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>. The vegetative shoot appears
    to be constructed on a plan similar to that of these two
    Palaeozoic genera, but the strobilus is of a different type. It
    would seem probable that <i>Pleuromeia</i> may be closely allied to
    <i>Isoetes</i> and to the arborescent Lycopods of Palaeozoic floras.
    It is not improbably a link in a chain of types which includes
    <i>Sigillaria</i> on the one hand and <i>Isoetes</i> on the other.</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that a specimen from the Lower
    Bunter of Commern which Blanckenhorn made the type of a
    new species, <i>Sigillaria oculina</i> (<a href="#fig134">fig. 134</a>, B) is specifically
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>identical with <i>Pleuromeia Sternbergi</i>. An examination of a
    cast of the type-specimen in the Berlin Bergakademie led me
    to regard the fossil with some hesitation as a true <i>Sigillaria</i>,
    but a more extended knowledge of <i>Pleuromeia</i> lends support to
    the view adopted by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> that Blanckenhorn’s plant is not
    genetically distinct from <i>Pleuromeia Sternbergi</i>. The resemblance
    between <i>Sigillaria oculina</i> and some of the Palaeozoic
    species of <i>Sigillaria</i> emphasised by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> has given rise to the
    belief that the genus <i>Sigillaria</i> persisted into the Triassic era; it
    is, however, highly probable that the Bunter specimen has no
    claim to the generic name under which it has hither to been known.</p>

  <p>The Bunter Sandstone in which <i>Pleuromeia</i> is the sole
    representative of plant-life, at least in certain localities, is
    usually considered to be a desert formation. We may not be far
    wrong in accepting Fitting’s suggestion that in this isolated
    species we have a relic of the sparse vegetation which was able
    to exist where the presence of lakes added a touch of life to the
    deadness of the Triassic desert.</p>

  <p><i>Pleuromeia</i> is recorded by Fliche as a rare fossil in the
    Middle Trias of France in the neighbourhood of Lunéville<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Herbaceous_fossil_species_of_Lycopodiales">Herbaceous fossil species of Lycopodiales.</h4>

  <p>The history of our knowledge of fossil representatives of the
    Lycopodiales, as also of the Equisetales, affords a striking
    illustration of the danger of attempting to found a classification
    on such differences as are expressed by the terms herbaceous
    and arborescent in the sense in which they are usually
    employed. As we have seen<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, the presence of secondary wood in
    stems of the Palaeozoic plant now known as <i>Calamites</i> led so
    competent a botanist as Adolphe Brongniart to recognise a
    distinct generic type <i>Calamodendron</i>, which he placed in the
    Gymnosperms, reserving the designation <i>Calamities</i> for species
    in which no indication of secondary thickening had been found.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the genus <i>Sigillaria</i> was regarded as a Gymnosperm
    because it was believed to be distinguished from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span><i>Lepidodendron</i> by the power of forming secondary vascular
    tissues; the latter genus, originally thought to be always
    herbaceous, was classed with the Pteridophytes. At the time
    when this unnatural separation was made between stems with
    secondary wood and those in which no secondary wood was
    known to exist, botanists were not aware of the occurrence of
    any recent Pteridophyte which shared with the higher plants
    the power of secondary growth in thickness provided by means
    of a meristematic zone. It is true that the presence or absence
    of a cambium does not in practice always coincide with the
    division into herbaceous and arborescent plants: no one would
    speak of a Date-Palm as a herbaceous plant despite the absence
    of secondary wood.</p>

  <p>The danger which should be borne in mind, in adopting as a
    matter of convenience the term herbaceous as a sectional
    heading, is that it should not be taken to imply a complete
    inability of the so-called herbaceous types to make secondary
    additions to their conducting tissues. The specimens on which
    the species of <i>Lycopodites</i> and <i>Selaginellites</i>, (genera which
    may be designated herbaceous,) are founded are preserved as
    impressions and not as petrifications; we can, therefore, base
    definitions only on habit and on such features as are shown
    by fertile leaves and sporangia. We are fully justified in
    concluding from evidence adduced by Goldenberg more than
    fifty years ago and from similar evidence brought to light by
    more recent researches, that there existed in the Palaeozoic era
    lycopodiaceous species in close agreement in their herbaceous
    habit with the lycopods of present-day floras. It has been
    suggested<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> that the direct ancestors of the genera <i>Lycopodium</i>
    and <i>Selaginella</i> are represented by the species of <i>Lycopodites</i>
    and <i>Selaginellites</i> rather than by <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>,
    the arborescent habit of which has been rendered familiar by
    the numerous attempts to furnish pictorial reproductions of a
    Palaeozoic forest. Until we are able to subject the species
    classed as herbaceous to microscopical examination we cannot
    make any positive statement as to the correctness of this view,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>but such facts as we possess lead us to regard the suggestion as
    resting on a sound basis.</p>

  <p>Palaeobotanical literature abounds in records of species of
    <i>Lycopodites</i>, <i>Lycopodium</i>, <i>Selaginella</i> and <i>Selaginites</i>, which
    have been so named in the belief that their vegetative shoots
    bear a greater resemblance to those of recent lycopodiaceous
    plants than to the foliage shoots of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. Many
    of these records are valueless: <i>Lepidodendra</i>, twigs of <i>Bothrodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
    species of conifers, fern rhizomes, and <i>Aphlebiae</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
    have masqueraded as herbaceous lycopods. It is obvious that
    an attempt to identify fossils presenting a general agreement in
    habit and leaf-form with recent species of lycopods must be
    attended with considerable risk of error. Recent Conifers
    include several species the smaller branches of which simulate
    the leafy shoots of certain species of <i>Lycopodium</i> and
    <i>Selaginella</i>, and it is not surprising to find that this similarity
    has been responsible for many false determinations. Among
    Mosses and the larger foliose Liverworts there are species which
    in the condition of imperfectly preserved impressions, might
    easily be mistaken for lycopodiaceous shoots: an equally
    close resemblance is apparent in the case of some flowering
    plants, such as New Zealand species of <i>Veronica</i>, <i>Tafalla
    graveolens</i> (a Composite), <i>Lavoisiera lycopodiodes</i> Gard.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> (a
    species of Melastomaceae), all of which have the habit of
    Cupressineae among the conifers as well as of certain lycopodiaceous
    plants. It may be impossible to decide whether fossil
    impressions of branches, which are presumably lycopodiaceous,
    bear two kinds of leaves<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> like the great majority of recent
    species of <i>Selaginella</i>. <i>Selaginella grandis</i>, if seen from the
    under surface, would appear to have two rows of leaves only
    and might be confused with a small twig of such a conifer as
    <i>Dacrydium Kirkii</i>, a New Zealand species.</p>

  <p>The New Zealand conifers <i>Dacrydium cupressinum</i> Soland.
    and <i>Podocarpus dacrydioides</i> Rich. closely simulate species of
    <i>Selaginellites</i> and <i>Lycopodites</i>: in the British Museum a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>specimen of the latter species bears a label describing it as
    <i>Lycopodium arboreum</i> (Sir Joseph Hooker and Dr Solander;
    1769). The twigs of the Tasmanian conifer <i>Microcachyrs</i>
    <i>tetragona</i> Hook. f. are very similar in habit to shoots of the
    recent <i>Lycopodium tetragonum</i> (<a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, C).</p>

  <p>In the description of examples of <i>Lycopodites</i> and <i>Selaginellites</i>
    I have confined myself to such as appear to be above
    suspicion either because of the presence of spore-bearing organs
    or, in a few cases, because the specimens of sterile shoots are
    sufficiently large to show the form of branching in addition to
    the texture of the leaves. The two generic names <i>Lycopodites</i>
    and <i>Selaginellites</i> are employed for fossil species which there
    are substantial grounds for regarding as representatives of
    <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>. The designation <i>Selaginellites</i> is
    adopted only for species which afford evidence of heterospory;
    the name <i>Lycopodites</i>, on the other hand, is used in a comprehensive
    sense to include all forms—whether homophyllous or heterophyllous—which
    are not known to be heterosporous. This
    restricted use of the generic name <i>Selaginellites</i> is advocated
    by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>, who instituted the genus, and by Halle<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> in his
    recent paper on herbaceous lycopods.</p>

  <h4 id="Lycopodites">Lycopodites.</h4>

  <p>The generic term <i>Lycopodites</i> was used by Brongniart in
    1822<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> in describing some Tertiary examples of slender axes
    clothed with small scale-like leaves which he named <i>Lycopodites
      squamatus</i>. These are fragments of coniferous shoots. In the
    <i>Prodrome d’une histoire des végétaux fossiles</i><a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Brongniart
    included several Palaeozoic and Jurassic species in <i>Lycopodites</i>
    and instituted a new genus <i>Selaginites</i>, expressing a doubt as to
    the wisdom of attempting to draw a generic distinction between
    the two sets of species. In a later work<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> he recognised only one
    undoubted species, <i>Lycopodites falcatus</i>. The first satisfactory
    account of fossils referred to <i>Lycopodites</i> is by Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>who gave the following definition of the genus:—“Branches
    with leaves spirally disposed or in whorls. Sporangia in the
    axil of foliage leaves or borne in terminal strobili.”</p>

  <p>It was suggested by Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> that Goldenberg’s definition,
    which was intended to apply to herbaceous species,
    should be extended so as to include forms with woody stems
    but which do not in all respects agree with <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    Kidston<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> subsequently adopted Lesquereux’s modification of
    Goldenberg’s definition. We cannot draw any well-defined line
    between impressions of herbaceous forms and those of small
    arborescent species. We use the name <i>Lycopodites</i> for such
    plants as appear to agree in habit with recent species of
    <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i> and which, so far as we know, were
    not heterosporous: it is highly probable that some of the
    species so named had the power of producing secondary wood,
    a power possessed by some recent Pteridophytes which never
    attain the dimensions of arborescent plants.</p>

  <p>It has been shown by Halle<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>, who has re-examined several
    of Goldenberg’s specimens which have been acquired by the
    Stockholm Palaeobotanical Museum, that some of his species
    of <i>Lycopodites</i> are heterosporous and therefore referable to
    Zeiller’s genus <i>Selaginellites</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1869 Renault described two species of supposed Palaeozoic
    Lycopods as <i>Lycopodium punctatum</i> and <i>L. Renaultii</i><a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, the
    latter name having been suggested by Brongniart to whom
    specimens were submitted. These species were afterwards
    recognised by their author as wrongly named and were
    transferred to the genus <i>Heterangium</i><a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, a determination which
    is probably correct; it is at least certain that the use of the
    name <i>Lycopodium</i> cannot be upheld.</p>

  <p>We have unfortunately to rely on specimens without
    petrified tissues for our information in regard to the history of
    <i>Lycopodites</i> and <i>Selaginellites</i>. Among the older fossils referred
    to <i>Lycopodites</i> are specimens from Lower Carboniferous rocks
    at Shap in Westmoreland which Kidston originally described
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>as <i>Lycopodites Vanuxemi</i><a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, identifying them with Goeppert’s
    <i>Sigillaria Vanuxemi</i><a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> founded on German material. In a later
    paper Kidston transferred the British specimens of vegetative
    shoots to a new genus <i>Archaeosigillaria</i><a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites Stockii</i> Kidston<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</h5>

  <p>The plant so named was discovered in Lower Carboniferous
    strata of Eskdale, Dumfries, Scotland; it is represented by
    imperfectly preserved shoots bearing a terminal strobilus and
    was originally described by Kidston as apparently possessing two
    kinds of foliage leaves borne in whorls. The larger leaves have
    an ovate cordate lamina with an acuminate apex, while the
    smaller leaves, which are less distinct, are transversely
    elongated, and simulate sporangia in appearance. Dr Kidston’s
    figure of this species has recently been reproduced by
    Professor Bower<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> who speaks of the supposed smaller leaves as
    sporangia, a view with which the author of the species agrees.
    It would appear that this identification is, however, based
    solely on external resemblance and has not been confirmed by
    the discovery of any spores. Assuming the sporangial nature
    of these structures, this Palaeozoic type represents, as Bower
    points out, a condition similar to that in some recent species of
    <i>Lycopodium</i> in which sporangia are not confined to a terminal
    strobilus but occur also in association with ordinary foliage
    leaves. The strobilus consists of crowded sporophylls which are
    too imperfect to afford any definite evidence as to their
    homosporous or heterosporous nature. As Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
    points out, this type recalls <i>Lycopodium Phlegmaria</i> among
    recent species.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites Reidii</i> Penhallow.</h5>

  <p>Professor Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> instituted this name for a specimen
    measuring 8 cm. long by 6 mm. in breadth, collected by Mr
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>Reid from the Old Red Sandstone of Caithness, consisting of an
    axis bearing narrow lanceolate leaves some of which bear
    sporangia at the base.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites Gutbieri</i> Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.</h5>

  <p>1894, <i>Lycopodites elongatus</i> Kidston<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> (not Goldenberg).</p>

  <p>The species, figured by Geinitz as <i>Lycopodites Gutbieri</i><a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>,
    from the Coal-Measures of Saxony is probably a true representative
    of the genus. The Saxon specimens are heterophyllous;
    the larger lanceolate and slightly falcate leaves
    arranged in two rows, are 4–5 mm. long while the smaller
    leaves are one half or one third this size; some of the
    dichotomously branched shoots terminate in long and narrow
    strobili not unlike those of Zeiller’s species <i>Selaginellites
      Suissei</i><a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> has included under this specific name some
    fragments collected by Hemingway from the Upper Coal-Measures
    of Radstock, Somersetshire, but as only one form of
    leaf is seen the reasons for adopting Goeppert’s designation are
    perhaps hardly adequate.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites ciliatus</i> Kidston<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</h5>

  <p>Under this name Kidston describes a small specimen,
    obtained by Hemingway from the Middle Coal-Measures of
    Barnsley in Yorkshire, consisting of a slender forked axis
    bearing oval-acuminate leaves approximately 5 mm. long with
    a finely ciliate margin. Associated with the leaves were found
    spores which Kidston regards as megaspores.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites macrophyllus</i> Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</h5>

  <p>This species, originally described by Goldenberg from the
    Coal-Measures of Saarbrücken has been re-examined by Halle<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
    who is unable to confirm Goldenberg’s statement as to heterophylly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
    The shoots closely resemble <i>Selaginellites primaevus</i><a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>

  <h5><i>Lycopodites Zeilleri</i> Halle<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. Fig. 135, C.</h5>

  <p>Halle has founded this species on specimens, from the Coal-Measures
    of Zwickau in Saxony, characterised by dimorphic
    lanceolate leaves in four rows, the larger being 4–6 mm. long:
    the smaller leaves have a ciliate edge. A comparison is made
    with the recent species <i>Selaginella arabica</i> Baker, <i>S. revoluta</i> Bak.,
    and <i>S. armata</i> Bak. in which the leaves are described as ciliate.
    In the absence of sporangia and spores the species is placed in
    the genus <i>Lycopodites</i>.</p>

  <p>Specimens referred to this species were originally recorded
    by Brodie from Rhaetic rocks in the Severn valley, the name
    <i>Naiadita</i> being chosen as the result of Lindley’s comparison of
    the small and delicate leaves with those of recent species of the
    Monocotyledonous family Naiadaceae. The species may be
    described as follows:</p>

  <p>Plant slender and moss-like in habit. The axis, which is
    delicate and thread-like, bears numerous linear acuminate or
    narrow ovate leaves reaching a length of approximately 5 mm.
    Under a low magnifying power the thin lamina of the leaves
    is seen to have a superficial layer of polygonal or rectangular
    cells arranged in parallel series (<a href="#fig136">fig. 136</a> <i>b</i>). There is no trace of
    midrib or stomata. The sporangia are more or less spherical
    and short-stalked, situated at the base of the foliage leaves and
    containing numerous tetrads of spores. The spores have a
    diameter of 0·08 mm.</p>

  <p>Buckman founded additional species on differences in the
    shape of the leaves but, as Miss Sollas has pointed out, such
    differences as he noticed may be detected on the same axis.
    It was stated in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> that Starkie Gardner, on
    insufficient evidence, proposed to place Brodie’s plant among
    the Mosses. The discovery by Mr Wickes of new material at
    Pylle hill near Bristol afforded an opportunity for a re-examination
    of the species: this was successfully undertaken by Miss
    Sollas who was able to dissolve out spores from the matrix by
    dilute hydrochloric acid, and to recognise the remains of internal
    structure in the slender axes by exposing successive surfaces
    with the aid of a hone. It was found that sporangia occurred
    at the base of some of the leaves containing numerous tetrads
    of spores, the individual spores having a diameter of 0·08 mm.,
    apparently twice as large as those of any recent species of
    <i>Lycopodium</i>. Fig. 136 shows a sporangium, <i>a</i>, at the base of
    a leaf, <i>b</i>. Indications of tubular elements were recognised in
    the stem and it is noteworthy that although the outlines of
    epidermal cells on the leaves are well preserved no stomata were
    found. The leaves of the recent American species <i>Lycopodium
    alopecuroides</i> Linn. var. <i>aquaticum</i> Spring<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, which lives
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>under water, possess stomata. It is probable that in <i>Lycopodites
    lanceolatus</i> the leaves had a very thin lamina and may have
    been similar in structure to those of recent Mosses; the plant
    possibly lived in very humid situations or grew submerged.
    Miss Sollas’s investigations afford a satisfactory demonstration
    of the lycopodiaceous nature of this small Rhaetic species: as
    I have elsewhere suggested<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>, the generic name <i>Lycopodites</i> should
    be substituted for that of <i>Naiadita</i>. Examples of this species
    may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>The Rhaetic species from Scania, <i>Lycopodites scanicus</i> Nath.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
    (<i>in litt.</i>), recently re-described by Halle and originally referred
    by Nathorst to <i>Gleichenia</i> affords another example of the
    occurrence of a small herbaceous lycopod of Rhaetic age.</p>

    bearing two rows of broadly falcate leaves. A careful examination
    of the type-specimen<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> revealed traces of what appeared to be
    smaller leaves, but there is no satisfactory proof of heterophylly.
    No sporangia or spores have been found. This British species
    has been recorded from Lower Jurassic or Rhaetic rocks of
    Bornholm<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and a similar though probably not identical type,
    <i>Lycopodites Victoriae</i><a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, has been recognised in Jurassic strata
    of Australia (South Gippsland, Victoria). An Indian plant
    described by Oldham and Morris<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> from the Jurassic flora of the
    Rajmahal hills as <i>Araucarites</i> (?) <i>gracilis</i> and subsequently
    transferred by Feistmantel to Schimper’s genus <i>Cheirolepis</i><a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
    may be identical with the Yorkshire species. The Jurassic
    fragments described by Heer from Siberia as <i>Lycopodites
    tenerrimus</i><a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> may be lycopodiaceous, but they are of no botanical
    interest.</p>

  <p>Other examples of Mesozoic Lycopods have been recorded,
    but in the absence of well-preserved shoots and sporangia they
    are noteworthy only as pointing to a wide distribution of <i>Lycopodites</i>
    in Jurassic and Cretaceous floras<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.</p>

  <p>From Tertiary strata species of supposed herbaceous lycopods
    have been figured by several authors, one of the best of which
    is <i>Selaginella Berthoudi</i> Lesq.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> from Tertiary beds in Colorado.
    This species agrees very closely in the two forms of leaf
    with <i>Selaginella grandis</i>, but as the specimens are sterile we
    have not sufficient justification for the employment of the
    generic name <i>Selaginellites</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

  <h4 id="Selaginellites">Selaginellites.</h4>

  <p>This generic name has been instituted by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> for
    specimens from the coal basis of Blanzy (France). It is applied
    to heterosporous species with the habit of <i>Selaginella</i>: Zeiller
    preferred the designation <i>Selaginellites</i> to <i>Selaginella</i> on the
    ground that the type species differs from recent forms in having
    more than four megaspores in each megasporangium. It is,
    however, convenient to extend the term to all heterosporous
    fossil species irrespective of the spore-output.</p>

  <h5><i>Selaginellites Suissei</i> Zeiller.</h5>

  <p>This species was described in Zeiller’s preliminary note<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> as
    <i>Lycopodites Suissei</i>, but he afterwards transferred it to the genus
    <i>Selaginellites</i>. In habit the plant bears a close resemblance to
    <i>Lycopodites macrophyllus</i> of Goldenberg; the shoots, 1–3 mm.
    thick, are branched in a more or less dichotomous fashion and
    bear tetrastichous leaves. The larger leaves reach a length of
    4–6 mm. and a breadth of 2–3 mm.; the smaller leaves are
    described as almost invisible, closely applied to the axis, oval-lanceolate
    and 1–2 mm. long with a breadth of 0·5–0·75 mm.
    Long and narrow strobili (15 cm. by 8–10 mm.) terminate the
    fertile branches; these bear crowded sporophylls with a triangular
    lamina and finely denticulate margin. Oval sporangia
    were found on the lower sporophylls containing 16–24 spherical
    megaspores 0·6–0·65 mm. in diameter. The outer membrane
    of the spore is characterised by fine anastomosing ridges and
    thin plates radiating from the apex and forming an equatorial
    collarette. The microspores have a diameter of 40–60μ and
    the same type of outer membrane as in the megaspores. The
    megaspores of the recent species <i>Selaginella caulescens</i>, as
    figured by Bennie and Kidston<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, resemble those of the Palaeozoic
    type in the presence of an equatorial flange. It is interesting
    to find that, in spite of the occurrence of 16–24 megaspores
    in a single sporangium the size of the fossil spores exceeds
    that of the recent species.</p>

  <p>The drawing reproduced in <a href="#fig138">fig. 138</a> is a copy of that of the type-specimen:
    another specimen, named by Goldenberg, is figured
    by Halle in his recently published paper. The leaves appear

    Halle is inclined to regard the plant as heterophyllous. The
    sporophylls, borne in slender terminal strobili, are smaller than
    the foliage leaves and spirally disposed (<a href="#fig138">fig. 138</a>; smaller
    specimen). Halle succeeded in demonstrating that some of
    the sporangia contained a single tetrad of spores, each spore
    having a diameter of 0·4–0·5 mm. No microspores were found,
    but it is clear that the species was heterosporous and that it
    agrees with recent species in having only four spores in the
    megasporangium.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The shoots of this species resemble the recent <i>Lycopodium
      complanatum</i>; they differ from those of <i>Selaginellites primaevus</i>
    in their long and narrow branches which bear two forms of leaf.
    The longer leaves, arranged in opposite pairs, are slightly falcate;
    the smaller leaves are appressed to the axis and have a triangular
    cordate lamina. Another peculiarity of this species is the
    occurrence of sporangia in the axil of the foliage leaves, a feature
    characteristic of the recent <i>Lycopodium Selago</i>. In recent
    species of <i>Selaginella</i> the sporophylls are always in strobili. No
    microspores have been found nor the walls of megasporangia,
    but tetrads of megaspores were isolated by Halle: the spores have
    three radiating ridges (<a href="#fig135">fig. 135</a>, B) connected by an equatorial
    ridge. Halle estimates the number of spores (0·45 mm. in
    diameter) in a sporangium at 20 to 30. In size as in number
    the spores exceed those of recent species and agree more nearly
    with the megaspores of <i>S. Suissei</i>.</p>

  <p>It would seem to be a general rule that the spores (megaspores)
    of the fossil herbaceous species exceeded considerably in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>dimensions those of recent forms and on the other hand were
    smaller than those of the Palaeozoic arborescent species.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that some of the Mesozoic and
    Tertiary species included under <i>Lycopodites</i> agree more closely
    with the recent genus <i>Selaginella</i> than with <i>Lycopodium</i>, but
    this does not constitute an argument of any importance against
    the restricted use of the designation <i>Selaginellites</i> which we
    have adopted. From a botanical point of view the various
    records of <i>Lycopodites</i> and <i>Selaginellites</i> have but a minor importance;
    they are not sufficiently numerous to throw any light
    on questions of distribution in former periods, nor is the preservation
    of the material such as to enable us to compare the fossil
    with recent types either as regards their anatomy or, except in
    a few cases, their sporangia and spores. The Palaeozoic species
    are interesting as revealing less reduction in the number of spores
    produced in the megasporangia. Among existing Pteridophytes
    the genus <i>Isoetes</i> agrees more closely than <i>Selaginella</i>, as regards
    the number of megaspores in each sporangium, with such fossils
    as <i>Selaginellites Suissei</i> and <i>S. elongatus</i>.</p>

  <p>It would seem that in most Palaeozoic species heterospory
    had not reached the same stage of development as in the recent
    genus <i>Selaginella</i> in which the megaspores do not exceed four
    in each sporangium. In <i>Selaginellites primaevus</i>, however, the
    heterospory appears to be precisely of the same type as in
    existing species.</p>

  <h4 id="Lycostrobus">Lycostrobus.</h4>

  <p>The generic name <i>Lycostrobus</i> has recently been instituted
    by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> for certain specimens of a lycopodiaceous strobilus,
    from the Rhaetic strata of Scania, which he formerly referred to
    the genus <i>Androstrobus</i><a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

  <h5><i>Lycostrobus Scotti</i> Nathorst. Fig. 139.</h5>

  <p>The fossil described under this name is of special interest as
    affording an example of a Mesozoic lycopodiaceous cone comparable
    in habit and in size with some of the largest examples
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>of Palaeozoic Lepidostrobi, the cones of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The
    Swedish fossil from Upper Rhaetic strata of Helsingborg (Scania)
    was originally designated <i>Androstrobus Scotti</i>, the generic name
    being adopted in view of the close resemblance of the form of
    the strobilus to the male flower of a Cycad. A more complete
    examination has shown that the bodies, which were thought to
    be pollen-sacs—though Nathorst recognised certain differences
    between them and the pollen-sacs of lycopods—are the
    megaspores of a lycopod. Microspores have also been identified.
    The axis of the cone has a breadth of 2 cm. with a peduncle
    which may be naked or provided with a few small scales; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    sporophyll region of the axis reached a length of at least 12 cm.
    The spirally disposed sporophylls terminate in a rhombic distal
    end which may represent the original termination or they
    may have been prolonged upwards as free laminae. Each
    sporophyll bears on its upper face a single large sporangium
    containing either megaspores or microspores: the megaspores,
    0·55–0·60 mm. in diameter, are finely granulate and bear small
    warty thorns or more slender pointed appendages. The microspores,
    after treatment with eau de Javelle, were found to
    measure 36–44μ while others which had been treated with
    ammonia reached 54μ in diameter. Nathorst describes the
    microspores as occurring in spherical groups or balls, which
    it is suggested may be compared with the groups of spores
    separated by strands of sterile tissue (trabeculae) in the large
    sporangia of <i>Isoetes</i> (cf. <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, H). If this comparison is sound
    it would point to a more complete septation of the sporangium
    in <i>Lycostrobus</i> than in any recent species of <i>Isoetes</i>. The size
    of the strobilus would seem to indicate the persistence into
    the Rhaetic era of an arborescent lycopodiaceous type; but the
    appearance and manner of preservation of the axis is interpreted
    by Nathorst as evidence of a herbaceous rather than
    a woody structure. He is disposed to regard <i>Isoetes</i> as the
    most nearly allied existing genus.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig139">
    <img class="illowp47" src="images/fig139.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 139. <i>Lycostrobus Scotti</i>, Nath. (After Nathorst; ⅘ nat. size.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The comparison made by Nathorst with <i>Isoetes</i> is based on
    a resemblance between the spores of the two genera and on the
    evidence, which is not decisive, of the existence of sterile
    strands of tissue in the sporangia of <i>Lycostrobus</i>. This
    similarity is however hardly of sufficient importance to justify
    the inclusion of the Rhaetic strobilus in the Isoetaceae. In
    size and in the arrangement and form of the sporophylls the
    cone presents a much closer resemblance to <i>Lepidodendron</i> than
    to <i>Isoetes</i>. It is probably advisable to regard this Rhaetic
    type simply as a lycopodiaceous genus which we are unable,
    without additional information, to assign to a particular position.</p>

  <p>The opinion expressed by Professor Fliche<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> that the plant
    described by Schimper and Mougeot as <i>Caulopteris tessellata</i>,
    a supposed tree-fern stem, from Triassic rocks of Lorraine, is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>more probably a large lycopodiaceous stem, either a <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    or a new genus, is worthy of note in reference to
    Nathorst’s account of <i>Lycostrobus</i>.</p>

  <p>In habit the fossil strobilus may be compared with the
    Triassic genus <i>Pleuromeia</i>, but the position of the sporangia on
    the sporophylls constitutes a well-marked difference. The
    most important result of Nathorst’s skillful treatment of this
    interesting fossil by chemical microscopic methods is the
    demonstration of the existence of a large heterosporous type of
    lycopodiaceous cone in a Rhaetic flora.</p>

  <h4 id="Poecilitostachys">Poecilitostachys.</h4>

  <p>Under this generic name M. Fliche<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> has briefly described a
    fertile lycopodiaceous shoot from the Triassic rocks of Epinal in
    France: the type species <i>Poecilitostachys Hangi</i> consists of a
    cylindrical axis, 10 cm. × 5 mm., deprived of leaves and terminating
    in a rounded receptacle bearing a capitulum of bracts or
    fertile leaves. Detached megasporangia containing small globular
    bodies found in association with the capitulum are compared
    with the megasporangia of <i>Isoetes</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the best known plants in the Palaeozoic floras are
    the genera <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>, types which are often
    spoken of as Giant Club-Mosses or as ancestors of existing
    species of <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>. Of these genera, but
    more particularly of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, we possess abundant
    records in a condition which have made it possible to obtain
    fairly complete information not only in regard to habit and
    external features but as to the anatomical characters of both
    vegetative and reproductive shoots. The structure of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    differs too widely from that of recent Club-Mosses (species
    of <i>Lycopodium</i>) to justify the statement that this prominent
    member of the Palaeozoic vegetation may be regarded as a direct
    ancestor of any living plant. There is at least no doubt that
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i> must be included in the Pteridophyta.
    The description by Dr Scott<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> of the genus <i>Lepidocarpon</i>,
    founded on petrified specimens of strobili, demonstrated the
    existence of a type of lycopodiaceous plant in the Carboniferous
    period distinguished from all living representatives of the
    group by the possession of integumented megaspores, which may
    fairly be styled seeds. <i>Lepidocarpon</i> and another seed-bearing
    plant <i>Miadesmia</i> are described under a separate heading as
    lycopodiaceous types characterised by an important morphological
    feature, which among recent plants constitutes a
    differentiating character between the Pteridophytes and the
    Phanerogams.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

  <h3 id="Lepidodendron">Lepidodendron.</h3>

  <h4 id="General">i. <i>General.</i></h4>

  <p>The genus <i>Lepidodendron</i> included species comparable
    in size with existing forest trees. A tapered trunk rose vertically
    to a height of 100 feet or upwards from a dichotomously
    branched subterranean axis of which the spreading branches,
    clothed with numerous rootlets, grew in a horizontal direction
    probably in a swampy soil or possibly under water. A
    description by Mr Rodway<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> of Lycopods on the border of a
    savannah in Guiana forming a miniature forest of Pine-like
    Lycopodiums might, with the omission of the qualifying
    adjective, be applied with equal force to a grove of Lepidodendra.
    The equal dichotomy of many of the branches gave to the tree a
    habit in striking contrast to that of our modern forest trees, but,
    on the other hand, in close agreement with that of such recent
    species of <i>Lycopodium</i> as <i>L. cernuum</i> (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>), <i>L. obscurum</i>
    (<a href="#fig124">fig. 124</a>) and other types. Linear or oval cones terminated
    some of the more slender branches (<a href="#fig188">fig. 188</a>) agreeing in size and
    form with the cones of the Spruce Fir and other conifers or with
    the male flowers of species of <i>Araucaria</i>, <i>e.g. A. imbricata</i>.
    Needle-like leaves, varying considerably in length in different
    species, covered the surface of young shoots in crowded spirals
    and their decurrent bases or leaf-cushions formed an encasing
    cylinder continuous with the outer cortex. The fact that leaves
    are usually found attached only to branches of comparatively
    small diameter would seem to show that <i>Lepidodendron</i>, though
    an evergreen, did not retain its foliage even for so long a period
    as do some recent conifers.</p>

  <p>By the activity of a zone of growing tissue encircling the
    cylinder of wood the main trunk and branches grew in thickness
    year by year: the general uniformity in size of the secondary
    conducting elements affords no indication of changing seasons.
    As the branches grew stouter and shed their leaves the surface of
    the bark resembled in some degree that of a Spruce Fir and other
    species of <i>Picea</i>, in which the leaf-scars form the upper limit of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>prominent peg-like projections, which, at first contiguous and
    regular in contour, afterwards become less regular and separated
    by grooves (<a href="#fig140">fig. 140</a>) and at a later stage lose their outline as the
    bark is stretched to the tearing point (<a href="#fig140">fig. 140</a>, C). The leafless
    branches of <i>Lepidodendron</i> were covered with spirally disposed
    oval cushions less peg-like and larger than the decurrent leaf-bases
    of <i>Picea</i>, which show in the upper third of their length a
    clean-cut triangular area and swell out below into two prominent
    cheeks separated by a median groove and tapering with
    decreasing thickness to a pointed base, which in some forms
    (<i>e.g. Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>, <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, C, D), is prolonged
    as a curved ridge to the summit of a lower leaf-cushion.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig140">

    <div class="caption chang mt1"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 140. <i>Picea excelsa.</i> Shoots of different ages showing changes in the appearance
      of the leaf-cushions: a leaf attached to a cushion in fig. A. (Slightly enlarged.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>A portion of the cushion below the triangular leaf-scar often
    shows transverse gaping cracks or depressions (<a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, C) such
    as occur on a smaller scale on the older cushions of a Fir twig
    (<a href="#fig140">fig. 140</a>). Secondary thickening, as in recent trees, is not confined
    to the vascular cylinder but at an early stage, frequently before
    there are any signs of secondary wood, the outer region of the
    broad cortex becomes the seat of active cell-formation which
    results in the addition of a considerable thickness to the bark.
    At a later stage of increase in girth, the leaf-cushions are stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
    apart and the original surface-features become obliterated by
    vertical cracks and by the exfoliation of the superficial tissues<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.</p>

  <p>Some species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> produced branches characterised
    by spiral or vertical series of scars; these in older shoots
    were replaced by depressions having a diameter of several inches
    and comparable in appearance, as also perhaps in manner of
    formation, with the scars left on the stem of a Kauri Pine
    (<i>Agathis australis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> on the abscission of lateral branches by a
    natural process. These shoots, known as <i>Ulodendron</i>, are
    described in a subsequent section. (<a href="#Page_128">page 128</a>.)</p>

  <p>A fully-grown <i>Lepidodendron</i> must have been an impressive
    tree, probably of sombre colour, relieved by the encircling felt of
    green needles on the young pendulous twigs. The leaves of
    some species were similar to those of a fir while in others they
    resembled the filiform needles of the Himalayan Pine (<i>Pinus
    longifolia</i>). The occasional presence of delicate hyphae in the
    tissues of <i>Lepidodendron</i> demonstrates susceptibility to fungal
    pests.</p>

  <p>Architecturally, if one may use the term, <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    owed its power of resistance to the bending force of the wind
    to its stout outer bark formed of thick-walled elements produced
    by the activity of a cylinder of cortical meristem (figs. <a href="#fig148">148</a>, <a href="#fig172">172</a>,
    etc.). The vascular axis, of insignificant diameter in proportion
    to the size of the stem (figs. <a href="#fig152">152</a>, <a href="#fig153">153</a>, <a href="#fig172">172</a>, <a href="#fig181">181</a>, A), must have
    played a subordinate part, from a mechanical point of view, as
    compared with the solid mass of wood of a Pine or an Oak.</p>

  <p>Within the compass of a text-book it is impossible, even if it
    were desirable, to include an account of the majority of the
    species of the widely distributed Palaeozoic genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    In spite of the great number of known species of this common
    member of Carboniferous floras, our knowledge of the type as a
    whole is deficient in many points, and such information as we
    possess needs systematising and extending by comparative
    treatment based on a re-examination of available data.</p>

  <p>In order to appreciate the meaning of certain external
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>features characteristic of Lepidodendron stems it is essential to
    have some knowledge of the internal structure.</p>

  <p>A dual system of terminology has been unavoidably adopted
    for species of <i>Lepidodendron</i>: the majority of specific names have
    been assigned to fossils known only in the form of casts or impressions,
    while petrified fragments, which unfortunately seldom
    show the surface-features, have received another set of names.
    A glance at the older palaeobotanical literature reveals the
    existence of several generic designations, which fuller information
    has shown to have been applied to lepidodendroid shoots
    deprived of some of their superficial tissues before fossilisation
    and differing considerably in appearance from the more complete
    branches of the same species<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. It has in some instances been
    possible to correlate the two sets of specimens, casts or impressions,
    showing external features, and petrified fragments.
    We may reasonably expect that future discoveries will enable
    us to piece together as definite specific types specimens at
    present labelled with different names.</p>

  <p>A well-preserved leaf-cushion of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>—the most
    obvious distinguishing feature of the genus—is rhomboidal or
    fusiform and vertically elongated (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, C, E; <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, C, D):
    in exceptional cases it may reach a length of 8 cm. and a breadth
    of 2 cm. The cushion as a whole represents a prominent portion
    of the stem or branch comparable with the elevation on the twig
    of a Spruce Fir and the leaf-base of a <i>Lycopodium</i> (cf. <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, A,
    lower portion) which appears in a transverse section of a branch
    as a rounded prominence (cf. <i>Lycopodium</i>, <a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, A and H).
    Disregarding differences in detail, a typical Lepidodendron
    leaf-cushion is characterised by a clearly defined smooth
    area often situated in the middle region (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, C, <i>s</i>).
    This is the leaf-scar or place of attachment of the base of
    the leaf which was cut off by an absciss-layer while the branch
    was comparatively young, as in recent forest trees and in some
    species of Ferns. On the leaf-scar are three smaller scars or
    cicatricules, the central one is circular or more or less triangular
    in outline, the two lateral scars being usually oval or circular.
    The central pit marks the position of the single vascular bundle
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>which constituted the conducting tissue connecting the leaf
    with the main vascular system of the stem. The two lateral
    scars (figs. <a href="#fig145">145</a>, A, <i>p</i>; <a href="#fig146">146</a>, C, <i>s</i>; <a href="#fig147">147</a>, <i>p</i>) represent the exposed ends
    of two strands of tissue, the forked branches of a strand which
    pass from the middle cortex of the stem into the leaf; this is
    known as the parichnos, a name proposed by Professor Bertrand
    in 1891<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

  <p>The specimen shown in <a href="#fig141">fig. 141</a> shows the linear leaves
    attached to their respective cushions.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The lamina has a well-defined median keel on the lower
    surface and on either side a groove in which sections of petrified
    leaves have demonstrated the occurrence of stomata (cf. <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>).</p>

  <h4 id="Leaves_and_Leaf_cushions">ii. <i>Leaves and Leaf-cushions.</i></h4>

  <p>All Lepidodendron leaves, so far as we know, possessed a
    single median vein only. In some species, as for example in
    <i>Lepidodendron longifolium</i> Brongn., they have the form of long
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>and slender acicular needles very similar to those of <i>Pinus
    longifolium</i>; in <i>L. Sternbergii</i> (<a href="#fig141">fig. 141</a>) they are much broader
    and shorter. In external form as in internal structure it is often
    impossible to distinguish between the leaves of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and <i>Sigillaria</i>. The distinguishing features enumerated by the
    late M. Renault cannot be employed, with any great degree of
    confidence, as diagnostic characters. In transverse section the
    lamina of a Lepidodendron leaf presents the same appearance as
    that of the Sigillarian leaves represented in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>. Near the
    base the free part of the leaf is usually sub-rhomboidal in section
    with short lateral wings, a ventral keel and two stomatal
    grooves (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, A, B, <i>g</i>). The form and arrangement of stomata
    are shown in <a href="#fig143">fig. 143</a>, A, which was drawn from a piece of a
    leaf shown in surface-view in a section lent to me by Professor
    Weiss. It should, however, be pointed out that the leaf cannot
    be certainly identified with <i>Lepidodendron</i> rather than with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, but as the leaves of these two genera are constructed
    on the same plan the identification is of secondary importance.</p>

  <p>The single xylem bundle consists of primary tracheae only, at
    least in such laminae as have been identified as Lepidodendroid.
    Surrounding the xylem strand occur delicate parenchymatous
    cells in some cases accompanied by darker and thicker-walled
    elements. As in <i>Sigillaria</i>, the leaves of which are more fully
    described on <a href="#Page_210">page 210</a>, a fairly broad sheath of wider and shorter
    scalariform or spiral transfusion tracheids surrounds the conducting
    strand (figs. <a href="#fig142">142</a>, <i>t</i>; <a href="#fig143">143</a>, B, C, <i>t</i>). As Renault shows in the
    case of <i>Lepidodendron esnostense</i><a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, the small leaves of which are
    1·5–2 mm. broad at the base and several centimetres long, the
    stomatal grooves and keel die out towards the apex when the
    lamina assumes a more nearly circular form (<a href="#fig143">fig. 143</a>, C).</p>

  <p>The area of the cushion excluding the leaf-scar is spoken of
    by some writers as the field. Below the leaf-scar the kite-shaped
    cushion tapers to a gradually narrowing basal position:
    in <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>, a species characteristic of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>Lower Carboniferous strata, it is seen to be continuous, as a
    ridge with sloping sides, with a lower cushion (<a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>).</p>

  <p>Below a leaf-scar the cushion frequently shows a pair of oval
    areas on which a fine pitting may be detected in well-preserved
    impressions, these oval scars, as seen in <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, D, are practically
    continuous at the upper end with the parichnos scars on the
    leaf-scar area; this is explained by the fact that these infra-foliar
    scars also owe their existence to patches of lacunar, aerenchymatous
    tissue in close connexion with the parichnos<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

  <p>Shortly before entering the base of the leaf-lamina the
    parichnos divides into two arms which diverge in the outer
    cortical region right and left of the vascular bundle, and passing
    obliquely upwards they come close to the surface of the leaf-cushion
    just below the leaf-scar. The diagram—<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B—shows
    a leaf-trace, <i>lt</i>, in the leaf-cushion, as seen in a diagrammatic
    drawing of a vertical radial section of a stem, the dotted lines,
    <i>p</i>, <i>p′</i>, show the two parichnos arms which are represented as
    impinging on the surface of the leaf-cushion at <i>p′</i>, and then
    bending upwards to pass into the leaf-base right and left of the
    vascular bundle or leaf-trace. For convenience the arms of the
    parichnos are represented in one plane though actually in
    different vertical planes.</p>

  <p>Fig. 144, A, shows the difference between a view of the
    original surface of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>, as at <i>a</i>, where a leaf-cushion
    with a leaf-scar is seen, and a view of an impression representing
    the outer cortex, <i>b</i>, a short distance below the surface. The
    surface <i>b</i>, in <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, A, corresponds to the face <i>d</i>-<i>e</i> in the diagrammatic
    longitudinal section <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B: the outline of each
    cushion is clearly visible and in the centre is seen the leaf-trace,
    <i>lt</i>, with its parichnos.</p>

  <p>The surface-features, <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, A), have been impressed on
    the rock, <i>c</i>, (<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B) in which the specimen was entombed
    and by the removal of the cast of the stem, that is the thickness <i>b</i>
    to <i>e</i> in <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B, the form of the leaf-cushion is revealed. The
    presence of the two infra-foliar parichnos scars at <i>p′</i> (<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, A)
    is explained by the diagram, <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B, <i>p′</i>.</p>

  <p>The relation of the parichnos to the oval scars below a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>Lepidodendron leaf-cushion has been worked out in detail by
    Weiss who shows that, at least in some species, the two arms
    do not bend downwards as shown in the diagram, <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B,
    but pursue a straight gradually ascending course as seen in
    <a href="#fig145">fig. 145</a>, A. Just below the leaf-scar region of the cushion each
    arm comes into association with a group of lacunar, aerenchymatous
    tissue, such as occurs in the roots of certain Mangrove
    plants, and it is this aerenchyma which is exposed on the two
    oval depressions below the leaf-scar. The structure of this
    aerenchyma is shown in <a href="#fig145">fig. 145</a>, B; it consists in this species
    (<i>L. Hickii</i> Wats.) of stellate cells which would constitute an
    efficient aerating system. Probably, as Weiss suggests, these
    patches of aerenchyma were originally covered by an epidermis
    provided with stomata, and it is owing to the destruction of this
    superficial layer that the two oval scars often form a prominent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    feature on Lepidodendron leaf-bases<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. The diagram reproduced
    in <a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, B, may be taken as practically correct, as the patches
    of aerenchyma described by Weiss do not differ essentially from
    the parichnos tissue.</p>

  <p>The parichnos scars are shown on the leaf-scar and cushion
    in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, C. In the lower leaf-cushion shown in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, E,
    the infra-foliar parichnos scars, <i>p</i>, are clearly seen, but the
    preservation of the leaf-scar is not sufficiently good to show them
    on that part of the fossil. In the upper cushion (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, E) the
    position of the parichnos arms is shown on the leaf-scar, but the
    infra-foliar parichnos scars are hidden by two small spiral
    shells. The genus <i>Spirorbis</i>, to which these shells are referred,
    appears to have persisted from the Silurian epoch to the present
    day. The comparatively frequent occurrence of <i>Spirorbis</i> shells
    on the leaves and other parts of Palaeozoic plants, has recently
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>been dealt with in a paper by Barrois<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> who discusses in detail
    the habitats of these small animals from the point of view of the
    conditions under which the plants were preserved. In a note by
    Malaquin appended to Barrois’ paper the belief is expressed
    that <i>Spirorbis</i> lived on pieces of Palaeozoic plants which lay
    under water.</p>

  <p>The fact that with one exception all the Spirorbis shells on
    the specimen of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, of which two leaf-cushions are
    shown in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, E, occur on the large parichnos scars on
    the cheeks of the cushions, suggests the possibility that the
    escape of gases from the parichnos tissue may have rendered
    the position attractive to the <i>Spirorbis</i>. It can hardly be
    accidental that the shells occur on the parichnos strands. This
    fact recalls the view held by Binney<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and accepted with favour
    by Darwin<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> that <i>Lepidodendron</i> and other coal-forest trees may
    have lived with the lower parts of the stems in sea water.</p>

  <p>Above the leaf-scar is a fairly deep triangular or crescentic
    pit (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, C, <i>l</i>) known as the ligular pit from the occurrence
    on younger shoots of a delicate organ like the ligule of <i>Isoetes</i>
    (<a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>) embedded in a depression in the upper part of the leaf-cushion.
    The ligule was first figured in <i>Lepidodendron</i> by
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and described in English material by Williamson
    under the name of the adenoid organ<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.</p>

  <p>In some Lepidodendron stems a second triangular depression
    may occur above the ligular pit, the meaning of which is not
    clear: this has been called the triangulum by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. Stur<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
    suggested that it may represent the position occupied by a
    sporangium in Lepidodendron cones.</p>

  <p>It is important to remember that as a branch increases in
    girth the leaf-cushions are capable of only a certain amount of
    growth: when the limit is reached they are stretched farther
    apart and thus the narrow groove which separates them is converted
    in older stems into a comparatively broad and flat
    channel, thus altering the surface characters.</p>

  <p>Another feature worthy of notice in reference to the leaf-cushions
    of <i>Lepidodendron</i> is the occurrence in rare instances of
    alternate zones of larger and smaller cushions. This variation
    in the size of the leaf-cushions is by no means uncommon in the
    closely allied genus <i>Sigillaria</i>; in <i>Lepidodendron</i> it has been
    described by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> in <i>L. volkmannianum</i> and more recently
    by Mr Leslie and myself<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> in a South African species <i>L.
    vereenigense</i>.</p>

  <p>Owing to the natural exfoliation of the superficial layers of
    the outer bark at a certain stage in the growth of the plant, or
    in some instances no doubt as the result of <i>post-mortem</i> decay,
    which destroys the delicate cells of the meristematic zone in the
    outer cortex, isolated leaf-cushions and strips of the external
    surface are occasionally met with as carbonised impressions.</p>

  <p>The appearance presented by a Lepidodendron stem which
    has been deprived of its superficial tissues may be dealt with
    more intelligibly after we have become familiar with the anatomical
    characters.</p>

  <h4 id="Lepidophloios">iii. <i>Lepidophloios</i>.</h4>

  <p>Before proceeding further with the genus <i>Lepidodendron</i> a
    short account may be intercalated of the external features of a
    lepidodendroid type of stem which it is customary to describe
    under a distinct generic title <i>Lepidophloios</i>. This name is convenient
    for diagnostic purposes though it seems clear that apart
    from the form of the leaf-cushion (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A) we are at present
    unable to recognise any well-defined differences between the
    two forms <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Lepidophloios</i>. For general
    purposes the name <i>Lepidodendron</i> will be used as including
    plants possessing leaf-cushions of the type already described as
    well as those with the Lepidophloios form of cushion.</p>

  <p>The generic name <i>Lepidophloios</i> was first used by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
    for a Carboniferous species which he had previously described
    as <i>Lepidodendron laricinum</i>. In 1845 Corda<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> instituted the
    name <i>Lomatophloios</i> for specimens possessing the same external
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>characters as those for which Sternberg had chosen the name
    <i>Lepidophloios</i>. The leaf-cushions of <i>Lepidophloios</i> differ from
    those of the true <i>Lepidodendron</i> in their relatively greater lateral
    extension (cf. <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A and C), in their imbricate arrangement
    and in bearing the leaf, or leaf-scar, at the summit. In some
    species referred to <i>Lepidophloios</i> the cushions are however
    vertically elongated and in this respect similar to those of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>: an example of this type is afforded by <i>Lepidophloios
    Dessorti</i> a French species described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. In
    younger branches the cushions may be directed upwards having
    the leaf-scar at the top; but in the majority of specimens
    the cushions are deflexed as in figs. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, D; <a href="#fig160">160</a>, A. The shoot
    of <i>Lycopodium dichotomum</i> shown in <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>, B, with the leaves
    in the reversed position bears a close resemblance to a branch
    of <i>Lepidophloios</i>.</p>

  <p>The photograph of <i>Lepidophloios scoticus</i> Kidst.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> reproduced
    in <a href="#fig160">fig. 160</a>, A, illustrates the dichotomous branching of the
    stem and the form of the cushions with the leaf-scars pointing
    downwards. In the fertile branch of the same species shown in
    <a href="#fig160">fig. 160</a>, B, the leaf-scars face upwards.</p>

  <p>In most species the cushions are simply convex without a
    median keel, but in some cases a median ridge divides the
    cushion into two cheeks as in the genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The
    leaf-scar bears three small scars, the larger median scar marking
    the position of the leaf-trace, while the lateral scars are formed
    by the two arms of the parichnos: in some examples of deflexed
    cushions, though not in all, a ligular pit occurs on the cushion a
    short distance above the leaf-scar.</p>

  <p>The drawing reproduced in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A, showing the leaf-scar
    on the upper edge of the cushion should have been reversed
    with the leaf-scars pointing downwards. This figure represents
    part of the surface of a specimen consisting of the outer cortex
    of a stem with leaf-cushions 3 cm. broad. The thickness of
    this specimen is 4 cm.: a section through the line <i>ab</i> is represented
    in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D (reproduced in the correct position, with
    the leaf-scars, <i>sc</i>, pointing downwards): internal to the cushions
    is a band of secondary cortex (the shaded strip on the outer
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>edge of the section) which was formed on the outside of the
    phellogen. The phellogen is a cylinder of actively dividing
    cells in the outer part of the cortex of the stem, often
    spoken of as the cork-cambium or cortical meristem, which
    produces a considerable amount of secondary cortical tissue on
    its inner face and a much smaller amount towards the stem
    surface. This delicate cylinder frequently forms a natural line
    of separation between the outer shell of bark and the rest of
    the stem. In the specimen before us, the thin-walled cells of
    the phellogen were ruptured before petrification and the outer
    shell of bark was thus separated as a hollow cylinder from the
    rest of the stem: this cylinder was then flattened, the two inner
    surfaces coming into contact. Fig. 146, D, represents a section
    of one half of the thickness of the flattened shell.</p>

  <p>This separation of the outer cortex, and its preservation
    apart from the rest of the stem, is of frequent occurrence in
    fossil lycopodiaceous stems. The flattened outer cortical shell
    of a <i>Lepidophloios</i>, specifically identical with that shown in
    <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A and D, was erroneously described by Dr C. E. Weiss
    in 1881 as a large lepidodendroid cone<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.</p>

  <p>Fig. 146, B, affords a view of the inner face of the specimen of
    which the outer surface is seen in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A: the surface shown
    in the lower part of the drawing, on which the boundaries of
    the cushions are represented by a reticulum, corresponds to
    the inner edge of the strip of secondary cortical tissue represented
    by the vertically shaded band in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D.</p>

  <p>The shaded surface in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, B, represents a slightly
    deeper level in the stem which corresponds to the outer edge of
    the vertically shaded band of <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D: the narrow tapered
    ridges (<a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, B) represent the leaf-traces passing through the
    secondary cortex, and the fine vertical shading indicates the
    elongated elements of which this strip of secondary cortex is
    composed.</p>

  <p>In the longitudinal section diagrammatically reproduced in
    <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D, cut along the line <i>ab</i> of <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A, the parenchymatous
    tissue of the stout cushions has been partially destroyed, as at
    <i>a</i>; at <i>s</i> is seen the section of a Stigmarian rootlet which has
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>found its way into the interior of a cushion. Each leaf-trace is
    accompanied by a parichnos strand as in the true <i>Lepidodendron</i>;
    at the base of the leaf-cushion the parichnos branches into
    two arms which diverge slightly right and left of the leaf-trace,
    finally entering the base of the leaf lamina as two lateral strands
    (<a href="#fig147">fig. 147</a>, <i>p</i>). At one point in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D the section has shaved a
    leaf-trace represented by a black patch resting on the parichnos
    just above the line <i>ef</i>, but it passes through one of the parichnos
    arms <i>p′</i> which debouches on to the leaf-scar <i>sc</i> at <i>p</i>. Had
    the section been cut along the line <i>cd</i> of <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A the leaf-trace
    would have been seen in a position similar to that occupied
    by the parichnos <i>p′</i> in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, D.</p>

    of some of the leaf-cushion tissue. It is worthy of notice that
    the parichnos cells have resisted decay more successfully than
    the adjacent tissue of the cushion.</p>

  <p>The diagrammatic sketches reproduced in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, H and I,
    were made from a transverse section similar to one originally

    the line <i>gh</i> in <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, A, passes through the ligular pit, <i>l</i>, and
    cuts across the parichnos in the act of branching; the leaf-trace
    passes outwards beyond the <span class="sans"><b>Y</b></span>-shaped parichnos strand. In the
    other section, <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>, I, the parichnos is shown in a horizontal

    <a href="#fig148">Figs. 148–155</a>, <a href="#fig148">168</a>, A.</h4>

  <p>In the earlier literature dealing with the anatomy of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and <i>Sigillaria</i> the presence or absence of secondary
    vascular tissue was made the criterion of generic distinction and
    the distinguishing feature between the classes Pteridophytes and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>Gymnosperms, <i>Lepidodendron</i> being relegated to the former class
    because it was supposed to have no power of forming secondary
    wood, while <i>Sigillaria</i>, characterised by a considerable development
    of such tissue, was classed by Brongniart and afterwards
    by Renault as a Gymnosperm. Binney<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> in 1865 recognised that
    the two types of stem pass into one another, but it was
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> who provided complete demonstration of the fallacy
    of the Brongniartian view.</p>

  <p>These two undoubted Pteridophytes agree very closely in
    anatomical structure and both are now recognised as arborescent
    genera of Lycopodiaceous plants. In a paper published by
    Lomax and Weiss in 1905<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> a specimen is described from the
    Coal-Measures of Huddersfield, in which a decorticated stem
    with the anatomical characters of Binney’s <i>Sigillaria vascularis</i>
    gives off a branch having the anatomical structure which it has
    been customary to associate with the species <i>Lepidodendron
      selaginoides</i>, so-called by Sternberg and founded by him on
    impressions showing well-preserved external characters.</p>

  <p>In 1862 Binney<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> described petrified specimens of vegetative
    shoots from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire under the
    names <i>Sigillaria vascularis</i> and <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>.
    These were afterwards recognised as different states of the
    same species. A few years after the publication of Binney’s
    paper Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> identified Binney’s species <i>Lepidodendron
    vasculare</i> with Sternberg’s <i>L. selaginoides</i>. The evidence on
    which this identification rests has not been stated, but many
    writers have retained this specific designation for the well-defined
    type of anatomical structure first described by Binney as
    <i>L. vasculare</i>. The use of the specific name <i>selaginoides</i> is, however,
    open to objection. The species <i>Lepidodendron selaginoides</i>,
    as pointed out by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>, is probably identical with the plant
    which Brongniart had named <i>L. Sternbergii</i> before the institution
    of Sternberg’s species, and we are not in possession of convincing
    evidence as to the connection of <i>L. Sternbergii</i> (= <i>L. selaginoides</i>)
    with specimens possessing the anatomy of Binney’s type.
    Binney’s designation is therefore retained for the anatomical type
    described in the following pages<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

  <p>The most detailed account hitherto published of the anatomy
    of <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i> is that by the late M. Hovelacque<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>,
    based on material from the Lower Coal-Measures of England.</p>

  <p>The small shoot, represented somewhat diagrammatically
    in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, illustrates the anatomical features of a typical
    example of the species: the shoot has a diameter of 2·5 cm. and
    its central cylinder (<i>x</i>-<i>sc</i>) is 2·5 mm. in width.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>Noticeable features are (i) the small size of the central
    cylinder (or stele) in proportion to the diameter of the branch,
    (ii) the production at a comparatively early stage of growth of a
    zone of secondary wood, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, which gradually assumes the form
    of a complete cylinder of unequal breadth, surrounding the
    primary xylem, <i>x</i>, (iii) the formation of a secondary cortical
    tissue by a meristematic cylinder (phellogen, <i>pl</i>) situated close
    to the leaf-cushion region of the outer cortex. On the outer
    edge the stele consists of narrow tracheae some of which show in
    longitudinal section the spiral form of thickening characteristic
    of most protoxylem elements: towards the centre of the stele the
    diameter of the tracheae gradually increases and parenchymatous
    cells become associated with the elongated scalariform elements.
    In the central region the stele is composed of parenchymatous
    tissue arranged in vertical series of short cells, interspersed with
    short tracheae distinguished by the greater thickness of their walls
    and by their scalariform and reticulate thickening bands. Some
    of these short tracheae are shown in vertical section in <a href="#fig149">fig. 149</a>, B:
    the fine and broken lines connecting adjacent thickening bands
    probably represent the remains of the original wall. These
    delicate bands, which have been figured in various species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
    of lepidodendroid plants<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, are worthy of notice in connexion
    with the recent work of Mr Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> who has shown
    that in many recent ferns the scalariform bands in the xylem
    elements are not connected by a thin pit-closing membrane, but
    are separated from one another by open spaces. In the Lepidodendron
    tracheae we seem to have a stage in which the intervening
    membrane is in process of absorption. It is, however,
    possible that the threads may be the result of contraction and
    splitting of the membrane during drying or decay.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The stele of <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>, before the addition of
    any secondary xylem, may be described as a protostele, a term
    originally proposed by Professor Jeffrey<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, in which the central part
    of the conducting strand of xylem elements has been converted
    into rows of parenchyma and short tracheids, the latter being
    better adapted to storage than to conduction. It is probable
    that this type of stelar anatomy, which distinguishes <i>L. vasculare</i>
    from other species, represents a comparatively primitive arrangement
    forming a transition between the stele of <i>L. esnostense</i>,
    which consists of a solid rod of tracheids, and the stele of
    <i>L. Harcourtii</i> (<a href="#fig179">fig. 179</a>, A) and other species in which the xylem
    forms a cylinder enclosing a large parenchymatous pith.</p>

  <p>Parenchymatous cells occur in contact with the outer edge
    of the xylem-cylinder some of which are distinguished by an
    irregular reticulate pitting. The tangential section represented
    in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, B, illustrates the appearance of a shoot of
    <i>L. vasculare</i> in which no secondary xylem is present: the central
    strand of tissue consists of the parenchyma abutting on the
    xylem with several leaf-traces (<i>lt</i>) passing upwards in an almost
    vertical course from the outer edge of the stele.</p>

  <p>The secondary xylem (<a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>) consists of radially
    arranged scalariform tracheae with associated rows of parenchymatous
    cells which form medullary rays (<a href="#fig149">fig. 149</a>, <i>mr</i>).
    Leaf-traces pass through the medullary rays in the secondary
    xylem cylinder in a direction at right angles to the primary xylem
    stele from which they are given off, but at the outer edge of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>secondary xylem they bend suddenly upwards and for a time
    follow a steep and almost vertical course.</p>

  <p>In well-preserved longitudinal sections the outermost
    secondary xylem tracheae are seen to be succeeded by a few
    narrow and vertically elongated elements (<a href="#fig149">fig. 149</a>, A, <i>a</i>),
    which represent young unlignified tracheae: these are followed
    by shorter parenchymatous cells (<i>m</i>) forming part of a meristematic
    zone from which the secondary xylem receives additions.</p>

  <p>Returning to <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A; the zone of secondary wood, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>,
    composed of scalariform tracheids and medullary rays, is succeeded
    by a few layers of parenchymatous cells and beyond this
    is a broader zone, <i>sc</i>, to which the term secretory zone has
    been applied<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; this is made up of small parenchymatous cells
    varying in size and of larger spaces which appear to have been
    formed by the disorganisation of thin-walled elements. The
    whole zone presents a characteristic appearance due to the
    association of small cells, large clear spaces, and a certain amount
    of dark-coloured material suggestive of tissue disorganisation
    and secreted products. The anatomical characters of the
    secretory zone are shown in the photograph, <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, A, <i>sc</i>.
    Several leaf-traces are seen in transverse section in the secretory
    zone (black dots in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, <i>sc</i>; <a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, C, <i>lt</i>): each trace
    consists of a strand of narrow tracheae accompanied by a few
    encircling layers of small parenchymatous cells. As a trace
    continues its steeply ascending course through the secretory zone,
    it becomes associated with a strand of that tissue and assumes the
    form of a collateral vascular bundle, the outer part of which does
    not consist of typical phloem but of shorter elements derived
    from the secretory zone. Beyond the secretory zone we find a
    more homogeneous tissue composed of parenchymatous elements
    slightly extended tangentially (<a href="#fig148">figs. 148</a>, A, <i>c</i><sup>1</sup>; <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, A, <i>c</i>);
    this is spoken of as the inner cortical region. In the great
    majority of sections of <i>L. vasculare</i> as of other species of the
    genus, the broader middle cortex (<a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>) is occupied by
    mineral matter, introduced subsequent to decay of the tissue;
    or it is represented by patches of delicate tissue composed of
    loosely arranged parenchymatous cells varying considerably in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>size and shape, some being small, oval or polygonal elements
    while others have the form of sinuous hypha-like tubes.</p>

  <p>In this middle cortical region may be seen leaf-traces passing
    outwards in an almost horizontal course (<a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, <i>lt</i>): after
    leaving the inner cortex the leaf-traces bend somewhat abruptly
    outwards to follow a more direct path through the middle and
    outer cortex. The ring of tissue, <i>s</i>, seen in the middle cortex
    of <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, belongs to a Stigmarian rootlet.</p>

  <p>The outer cortex (<a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A and B, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>) consists of homogeneous
    parenchyma which is stronger and more resistant to
    decay than the looser middle cortex. The leaf-traces, as shown
    in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, B, pass through this region in a rather steeply
    ascending direction: each is seen to be enclosed by a space
    originally occupied by a strand of middle cortical tissue which
    accompanies lepidodendroid leaf-traces on their under side and
    has already been described as the parichnos, (<a href="#Page_97">pp. 97</a>, <a href="#Page_100">100–103</a>;
    <a href="#fig146">figs. 146, 147</a>).</p>

  <p>The surface of the stem shown in section in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, is
    composed of broad leaf-cushions. A single leaf-trace with its
    parichnos passes into each cushion, but in the neighbourhood
    of the base of a cushion the parichnos bifurcates (cf. <a href="#fig146">fig. 146</a>,
    H, I) and the arms diverge slightly to the right and left finally
    passing beyond the cushion into the lamina of the leaf, their
    position being shown, as already explained, by the two small
    lateral scars on the leaf-scar area.</p>

  <p>The diagrammatic sketch of a radial longitudinal section
    through a leaf-cushion represented in <a href="#fig150">fig. 150</a> illustrates the
    relation of the leaf-trace to the leaf-cushion. The trace consists
    of xylem, <i>x</i>, above and a strand of the secretory zone, <i>st</i>, below;
    the parichnos tissue was originally present on the under side of
    the leaf-trace at <i>a</i>. The external surface, <i>bc</i>, marks the limit
    of the leaf-scar through the middle of which passes the vascular
    strand <i>lt</i>.</p>

  <p>The lower gap <i>a</i> has been formed by the tearing of thin-walled
    cells of the phellogen, the meristematic tissue from
    which a considerable amount of secondary cortical tissue or
    phelloderm has been produced at <i>pd</i>. On the outside of the
    cushion, <i>c</i>, the cells are somewhat crushed and distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
    by their darker colour from the bulk of the parenchymatous
    tissue <i>d</i>.</p>

  <p>This section also illustrates another characteristic feature of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, namely the presence of a ligule and a ligular
    pit: the former is represented by a carbonised patch of tissue and
    the latter extends from the surface of the cushion at <i>b</i>, just
    above the leaf-scar, almost to the level of the leaf-trace, <i>lt</i>. A
    comparison of this section with <a href="#fig146">figs. 146 and 147</a> will make
    clear the relation of the several parts of the cushion and leaf-scar.</p>

  <p>The gaps <i>gg</i>, seen in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A and B, mark the position of
    the delicate meristematic zone or phellogen which arises close
    to the bases of the leaf-cushions; the phellogen has already produced
    a few rows of radially disposed elements, represented by
    short radial lines in the drawing, which constitute secondary
    cortical tissue.</p>

  <p>In older shoots the amount of the secondary cortical

  </div>

  <p>The section (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, A) measures 7 × 3·8 cm. in diameter;
    the primary xylem is surrounded by a fairly broad cylinder
    of secondary wood (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, E, <i>x</i> and <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>). The almost smooth
    surface of the primary wood (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, E, <i>x</i>) is succeeded by the
    secondary xylem, <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>, characterised at its inner edge by the
    tapered ends of the radial rows of scalariform tracheids between
    which occur several delicate parenchymatous cells (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, E, <i>a</i>).
    The occurrence of such isodiametric elements, often exhibiting
    a delicate spiral thickening band, is a characteristic feature of
    the boundary between primary and secondary wood in lepidodendroid
    stems. The secondary wood is penetrated by numerous
    medullary rays and in some of them are seen strands of narrow
    spirally thickened tracheae—the leaf-traces—which are in
    organic continuity with the exarch protoxylem of the primary
    wood. The leaf-traces are oval and mesarch. The space, <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>,
    (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, A) originally occupied by the delicate middle cortex,
    is succeeded by a shell of outer cortex composed chiefly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
    secondary tissue (phelloderm, <i>pd</i>) passing towards the inner
    boundary of this region into the primary outer cortex <i>g</i> (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>,
    A and C). The radially disposed elements which make up the
    bulk of the phelloderm are associated with concentric rows of
    secretory strands, represented by tangentially arranged dots in
    <a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, A: on the outer edge of the phelloderm a few patches of
    primary cortex are still preserved, as at <i>c</i>, fig. A. One of these
    is shown on a larger scale in fig. B; at <i>m</i> the phelloderm is
    interrupted by a gap beyond which the cells have thinner walls
    and show signs of recent division; this is probably the position
    of the phellogen. The tissue <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, B, consists of secondary
    cortex succeeded beyond <i>d</i> by the parenchymatous tissue of the
    leaf-cushion, in which the remains of a ligule, <i>l</i>, are seen in the
    ligular pit. This section corresponds in position to a line
    drawn across <a href="#fig150">fig. 150</a> at the level of <i>b</i>. In this specimen we
    have two kinds of secondary cortical tissue: that formed external
    to the phellogen, from <i>m</i> to <i>d</i> in <a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, B, is less in amount
    than that produced internal to the phellogen. We cannot make
    any satisfactory statement as to the nature of this secondary
    tissue, whether or not any of it agreed in composition with the
    cork which is usually formed external to the phellogen in recent
    plants. As the stem of a <i>Lepidodendron</i> grew in girth the leaf-cushions
    became separated by intervening depressions composed
    of the secondary cortex formed external to the phellogen, but at
    a later stage the cushions were thrown off, leaving the outer
    edge of the phelloderm as the superficial tissue. This exposed
    tissue became fissured as growth and consequent stretching
    continued, producing the appearance seen on the surface of
    the still older stem represented in <a href="#fig153">fig. 153</a>.</p>

  <p>The inner edge of the phelloderm seen at <i>e</i> in <a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, C,
    passes suddenly into the inner primary region of the outer cortex
    (<a href="#fig151">fig. 151</a>, A and C, <i>g</i>) which comprises two types of parenchymatous
    tissue, patches of isodiametric cells, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, alternating
    with radially arranged areas consisting of tangentially elongated
    elements (fig. C, <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>; fig. D) which extend as wedges into the
    phelloderm.</p>

  <p>The longitudinal section represented in <a href="#fig152">fig. 152</a>, B, shows an
    equal bifurcation of a stem in which no secondary xylem is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
    present; in the lower part of the section the xylem and the
    outgoing leaf-traces are seen in radial section and at the upper
    end of each arm the leaf-traces alone, <i>lt</i>, are exposed, as in
    <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, B. It is interesting to notice the large amount of
    phelloderm which has been produced in the fork of the branch,
    at <i>pd</i>, where greater strength is required.</p>

    of secondary xylem; the amount is greater in the case of the
    right-hand stele, of which a small piece is shown on a larger
    scale; the striking contrast in size between the outer and more

  </div>

  <p>An interesting example of a small shoot, the largest
    diameter of which is 2·8 cm., is shown in <a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, A: the section
    was cut a short distance above the bifurcation of the stele into
    two approximately equal branches. The outer part of the
    cortex consists of phelloderm, <i>pd</i>, with the usual rows of
    secretory tracts, and primary outer cortex <i>g</i>; the middle cortex
    is represented by patches of parenchyma with a few leaf-traces.
    To one of the steles, <i>s′</i> (<a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, A), a crescent-shaped band of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    secondary xylem has been added; the other stele, <i>S</i>, possesses
    no fully developed secondary elements.</p>

  <p>Fig. 154, B and C, illustrates the anatomical features immediately
    external to the primary xylem of the smaller stele, <i>s</i>. The
    comparatively broad band of radially disposed parenchyma, <i>m</i>,
    is connected with the outermost elements of the xylem by a
    few rather dark and small crushed parenchymatous cells. The
    band <i>m</i>, which we may speak of as the meristematic zone,
    clearly consists of cells in a state of division; it is in this region
    that the secondary xylem is produced. Beyond the leaf-trace,
    (<a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, C, <i>lt</i>), occurs a portion of the secretory zone, some of the
    smaller cells of which show signs of disorganisation; but most of
    this tissue has been destroyed (<a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, B, <i>sc</i>). The outer edge of
    the secretory zone is shown in <a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, D abutting on the cells
    of the inner cortex, <i>c′</i>. The leaf-trace shown in the inner cortex
    in <a href="#fig154">fig. 154</a>, B illustrates the more oval or tangentially extended
    form of the xylem in this region, in contrast to the more circular
    outline which it exhibits on the inner side of the secretory
    zone.</p>

  <p>The transverse section, part of which is reproduced in
    <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, A, illustrates a characteristic feature, namely the
    juxtaposition of the outermost tracheae of the secondary xylem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
    and much smaller cells of the meristematic zone. This is seen
    in <a href="#fig155">fig. 155</a>, which shows a small piece of <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, A, on a larger
    scale. In plants with a normal cambium the segments cut off
    from the initial layer fit on to the elements of the xylem or
    phloem to which they are to form additions, but in <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    it seems to be a general rule to find each of the most
    external lignified elements abutting on a group of two or three
    much smaller cells. It is difficult to believe that the meristem
    shown in <a href="#fig155">fig. 155</a>, <i>m</i>, could produce secondary xylem elements
    equal in size to those already formed: in all probability had
    growth continued there would have been a marked difference
    between the size of the secondary tracheids, as in <a href="#fig152">fig. 152</a>, A, <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>,
    where there was no doubt some cause which interfered with
    normal cambial activity. This disparity in size between the
    secondary xylem elements and the adjacent parenchymatous
    tissue of the meristematic zone is by no means exceptional and
    may be described as the general rule. It is at least certain
    that in <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>, as in other species, the secondary
    xylem was succeeded by a broad band of parenchymatous
    tissue, from which new tracheae and medullary-ray elements
    were produced, and not by a narrow cambium such as occurs
    in recent plants.</p>

  <h4 id="Lepidodendron_stems">v. Lepidodendron <i>stems as represented by casts and
      impressions of partially decorticated specimens.</i></h4>

  <p>The differentiation of the outer cortex of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    into comparatively thin-walled and more resistant tissue has
    been the cause of unequal decay and the consequent formation
    of shrinkage cavities. In addition to the unequal resisting
    power of contiguous tissues, another important factor in determining
    the nature of casts and impressions is the existence of
    the cylinder of delicate cells in the outer cortex of stems and
    branches. As already pointed out, this meristematic cylinder
    or phellogen constitutes a natural line of separation, as in the
    case of the cambium layer between the wood and the external
    tissues in a fresh Sycamore twig. The result of the separation
    of an outer shell of bark from the rest of the stem and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
    results of unequal decay in the more superficial tissues, have
    necessarily led to the preservation of the same specific type
    under a variety of forms.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the anatomy of Lepidodendron stems
    enables us to recognise in fossils of very different appearance
    specimens in various conditions of preservation of one and
    the same type. Such names as <i>Knorria</i>, <i>Bergeria</i> and <i>Aspidiaria</i>
    are examples of generic titles instituted before any
    adequate knowledge of Lepidodendron anatomy was available.</p>

  <p>Differences in age as well as different degrees of decortication
    have contributed in no small measure to the institution of
    generic and specific names which more recently acquired knowledge
    has shown to be superfluous.</p>

  <h5 id="Knorria"><i>a.</i> <i>Knorria.</i></h5>

  <p>The designation Knorria, after a certain G. W. Knorr of
    Nürnberg, was proposed by Sternberg in 1826<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> for casts of
    Palaeozoic stems of a type figured more than a century earlier
    by Volkmann<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. Goeppert, in his earlier works, published drawings
    of fossil stems which he referred to Sternberg’s genus: one
    species he at first called <i>Didymophyllum Schollini</i>. He afterwards<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
    described some specimens which showed that the
    features characteristic of <i>Knorria</i> may occur on partially decorticated
    stems with leaf-cushions of the true Lepidodendron
    type. His specimens, preserved in the Breslau Museum,
    demonstrate the accuracy of his drawings and conclusions.
    Goeppert, and after him Balfour<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, drew attention to the different
    appearances presented by branches of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i> when
    preserved with the surface intact and after partial decortication,
    as illustrating possible sources of error in the determination of
    fossil stems.</p>

  <p>Although it is now a well-established fact that fossils bearing
    the name <i>Knorria</i> are imperfect lepidodendroid stems, the
    use of the term may be conveniently retained for descriptive
    purposes. The specimen from the Commentry coal-field of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>France, shown in <a href="#fig156">fig. 156</a>, affords some excuse for the institution
    of several generic names for different states of preservation
    or decortication of one species. The cortical level exposed at <i>e</i>
    is characterised by spirally disposed peg-like ridges with truncated
    apices: it is this form of cast which is usually designated
    <i>Knorria</i>. The ridges vary in size and shape in different types
    of stem; they may be narrow as shown at <i>e</i>, <a href="#fig156">fig. 156</a>, or short
    and broad with rounded distal ends. In some cases they are
    forked at the apex, as in the partially decorticated specimen
    of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> represented in <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, A.</p>

        <i>a–g</i>, surface features exposed as the result of different degrees of

  <p>The <i>Knorria</i> state represents the impression or cast of the
    outer cortical region too deep below the leaf-cushion region to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    retain any indications of the cushion-form; the ridges are the
    casts of the spaces produced in the cortex by the decay of the
    sheath of delicate cells surrounding each leaf-trace and by the
    decay of the thin-walled cells of the parichnos. The occasional
    forked apex of a ridge is the expression of the fact that the cast
    was made at the region where the parichnos divides into two arms
    (cf. p. 100). In certain specimens it is possible to connect the
    Knorria casts with associated lepidodendroid stems which may
    be determined specifically; but when we have no evidence as to
    surface-features the fossils may be designated casts of lepidodendroid
    stems in the Knorria condition. Such casts are illustrated
    by numerous drawings in palaeobotanical literature<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="Bergeria"><i>b.</i> <i>Bergeria.</i></h5>

  <p>This is another name first used by Sternberg in his classic
    work, <i>Die Flora der Vorwelt</i>, for casts of lepidodendroid plants
    such as Steinhauer<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> had previously figured as <i>Phytolithus
    cancellatus</i>. Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> recognised that the application of the
    generic title <i>Lepidodendron</i> should be extended to include
    specimens referred by Sternberg to <i>Bergeria</i>, and a few years
    later Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> realised that this name does not stand
    for well-defined generic characters. The correctness of these
    views was, however, first satisfactorily demonstrated by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
    and by Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

  <p>If a Lepidodendron stem loses its superficial layers of outer
    cortex and in this condition is embedded in sand or mud, the
    cast is distinguished from that of a perfect stem by the absence
    of the leaf-scars and by other features. It may, however, still
    show spirally disposed areas, corresponding approximately to
    the original leaf-cushions, which are characterised by a small
    depression or pit either at the apex or near the centre of each
    oval area: the pit marks the position of the leaf-trace and its
    parichnos strand. In some cases the exposed surface may be
    smooth without any indication of leaf-cushions, while narrow
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>spirally arranged grooves represent the obliquely ascending
    vascular bundles passing through the cortex to the leaves.</p>

  <p>Fig. 185, B, shows the Bergeria state of <i>Lepidodendron
    Veltheimianum</i>, which differs from the Knorria condition in the
    fact that decortication had not extended below the level at
    which the form of the leaf-cushions could be recognised. It is
    clear that no sharp line can be drawn in all cases between the
    different degrees of decortication as expressed by the terms
    <i>Knorria</i> and <i>Bergeria</i>.</p>

  <p>A list of synonyms of <i>Knorria</i>, <i>Bergeria</i>, and <i>Aspidiaria</i>
    forms of stem and a detailed treatment of their characteristic
    features may be found in a recent work by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="Aspidiaria"><i>c.</i> <i>Aspidiaria.</i></h5>

  <p>In one of the earliest English books on fossil plants, the
    <i>Antediluvian Phytology</i> by Artis<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, a specimen from the Carboniferous
    sandstone of Yorkshire is figured as <i>Aphyllum
      cristatum</i>, and a similar fossil is described as <i>A. asperum</i>.
    These are impressions of Lepidodendron stems in which the
    characteristic leaf-cushions are replaced by smooth and slightly
    convex areas with a narrow central ridge. To this type of
    specimen Presl gave the name <i>Aspidiaria</i><a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, under the impression,
    shared by subsequent writers, that the supposed external
    features were entitled to generic recognition.</p>

  <p>It is to Stur<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> that we owe the first satisfactory interpretation
    of fossils included under the name <i>Aspidiaria</i>: he showed that
    on the removal of the projecting convex areas from some of his
    specimens a typical Lepidodendron leaf-cushion was exposed
    (<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, A, <i>a</i>). The Aspidiaria condition (<a href="#fig144">fig. 144</a>, A, <i>b</i>) represents
    the inner face of the detached shell of outer bark of a
    Lepidodendron stem, while in the Bergeria casts we have a
    view of the external face of a stem deprived of its superficial
    tissues.</p>

  <p>In a Lepidodendron stem embedded in sediment the more
    delicate portions of the leaf-cushions would tend to shrink away
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>from the internal and more resistant tissues of the outer cortex,
    thus producing spaces between each cushion; further decay
    would cause rupture of the leaf-traces and the superficial tissues
    would thus be separated from the rest of the stem. The
    tendency of Lepidodendron stems to split along the line of
    phellogen in the outer cortex is seen in <a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>, A, <i>g</i>. The
    deposition of sediment on the exposed inner face of this cortical
    shell would result in the production of a specimen of the
    Aspidiaria type: the reticulum enclosing the spirally disposed
    convex areas is formed by the impression of the firmer tissue
    between the leaf-cushions.</p>

  <h4 id="Lepidodendroid_axes">vi. <i>Lepidodendroid axes known as</i> Ulodendron <i>and</i> Halonia.</h4>

  <h5 id="Ulodendron"><i>a</i>. <i>Ulodendron.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name was suggested by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
    for two specimens from the English Coal-measures characterised
    by leaf-cushions like those of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>, but distinguished
    by the presence of two vertical rows of large and more or less
    circular cup-shaped scars. These authors, while recognising
    the possibility that the fossils might be identical with <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
    regarded them as generically distinct. The generic
    title <i>Ulodendron</i>, though no longer denoting generic rank, is
    still applied to certain shoots of lycopodiaceous plants which
    may belong to the genera <i>Lepidodendron</i>, <i>Bothrodendron</i>, and
    according to some authors<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>, also to <i>Sigillaria</i>.</p>

  <p>The large specimen from the Belgian coal-measures, represented
    in <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a>, affords a good example of the Ulodendron
    form of shoot of the genus <i>Bothrodendron</i>, which is described on
    <a href="#Page_249">page 249</a>. The specimen shown in <a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a> shows the <i>Ulodendron</i>
    shoot of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>.</p>

  <p>Casts of large Ulodendron scars are occasionally met with
    as separate fossils bearing a resemblance to an oval shell.</p>

  <p>In Steinhauer’s paper on <i>Fossil Reliquiae</i><a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> a drawing is given
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>of a Ulodendron stem under the name <i>Phytolithus parmatus</i>
    and a similar stem specifically identical with that shown in
    <a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a> was figured by Rhode<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, one of the earliest writers on
    fossil plants, under the comprehensive designation “Schuppenpflanze.”</p>

  <p>There has been no lack of ingenuity on the part of authors
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>in offering suggestions as to the meaning of these large cup-like
    depressions, and there is still difference of opinion as to
    their significance. Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> described them as the
    scars of branches or masses of inflorescence. Sir Joseph
    Hooker<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> speaks of a specimen of <i>Ulodendron</i>, shown to him by
    Mr Dawes, on which a large organ, supposed to be a cone, was
    inserted in one of the depressions, but he was unable to arrive
    at any conclusion as to the real nature of the fossil. While
    most authors have seen in the scars pressure-areas formed by the
    pressure of sessile cones against the surface of a growing branch,
    others, as for example Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>, have described the depressions
    as branch-scars. Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> regarded the scars as those of
    adventitious roots and Williamson referred to them as the
    scars of reproductive shoots. The depressions vary considerably
    in size. The Belgian example shown in <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a> possesses scars
    9 cm. in diameter. A specimen of <i>Bothrodendron</i> in the Manchester
    Museum from the Lancashire Coal-Measures, to which
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> has referred, bears two rows of scars 11–12 cm.
    in diameter on a stem 112 cm. in girth and 233 cm. long. The
    scars occur in two alternate series, on opposite faces of the
    axis, the distance between the successive scars in the same row
    being 29 cm. The surface-features of this large stem are not
    preserved.</p>

  <p>Before considering the nature and origin of the scars it is
    important to remember the considerable size to which they
    may attain; other points of importance are the occurrence,
    either in the centre of each depression or in an excentric
    position, of an umbilicus or slightly projecting boss, in the
    centre of which is a pit formed by the decay of an outgoing
    vascular strand. The sloping sides of the scars sometimes
    bear elevations resembling leaf-cushions like those on the rest
    of the stem surface. In the specimen shown in <a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a> the
    lower margin of each cup shows indistinctly the outlines of what
    appear to be leaf-cushions, while the rest of the sloping face is
    characterised by radial ridges, which may be due to bracts or
    leaves.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

  <p>It is obvious that in these cups we have the scars of some
    lateral organ, but the evidence afforded by specimens of which
    the depressions contain the remains of such organs is by no
    means conclusive. A Ulodendron has been figured by D’Arcy
    Thompson<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>, in which the lower part of a lateral organ is
    attached by a narrow base to one of the scars, but the preservation
    is not sufficiently good to enable us to decide whether
    the organ is a cone or a vegetative shoot. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> has
    described other examples showing portions of organs in connexion
    with the scars, but an examination of the specimens in
    his collection failed to convince me that his interpretation of
    them as strobili is correct.</p>

  <p>The phenomenon known as cladoptosis, as shown on a stem
    of the Conifer <i>Agathis</i><a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and certain Dicotyledonous trees such
    as <i>Castilloa</i>, suggests a possible explanation of the Ulodendron
    scars. This comparison was made by Shattock<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> in 1888, but he
    did not accept the resemblance as a real one. An objection
    may be urged to the cladoptosis hypothesis that in <i>Ulodendron</i>
    the branch, whether vegetative or reproductive, was not
    attached to the whole of the depressed area. On the other
    hand, a lateral branch originally attached by a narrow base
    may have continued to increase in diameter until its base
    became slightly sunk in the bark of the stem, thus producing a
    cup-like depression which, on the fall of the branch, would
    retain traces of the original surface-features of the stem.</p>

  <p>Mr Watson<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> of Manchester recently published a paper on
    Ulodendron scars, in which he adduces fresh and, as it seems
    to me, satisfactory arguments in favour of the branch-scar
    hypothesis. Fig. 158, from one of Mr Watson’s blocks,
    illustrates the nature of his evidence. He points out that in
    the obverse half of a large specimen of <i>Bothrodendron</i> in the
    Manchester Museum, the umbilicus consists of a cylindrical
    hole, 18 mm. deep and 8 mm. in diameter, surrounded by a
    projecting ring of mineral material which doubtless represents
    some portion of the original plant: on the reverse half of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>specimen the continuation of the ring is seen as a prominent
    cone fitting into the cup-like depression in the obverse half: the
    conical cast shows that numerous small vascular strands were
    given off from this ring of tissue, and these strands have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
    same arrangement and size as the dots which are found on
    typical Ulodendron scars. He interprets the ring surrounding
    the umbilicus as the remains of the primary wood and the
    small strands as leaf-traces supplying the branch.</p>

      Branch theory of the Ulodendroid scar. (After Watson.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the diagrammatic section shown in <a href="#fig158">fig. 158</a> the outer
    cortex of the main stem is represented by <i>oc</i> 1; this consists of
    secondary tissue. The corresponding tissue in the branch is
    seen at <i>oc</i> 2. The stele of the stem is shown at Tr. St. and
    that of the branch at Br. St.; <i>lt</i>, <i>lt</i>, mark the position of the
    leaf-traces. If we assume the branch to be detached along
    the line LS, the depression would show numerous spirally
    arranged dots representing the points of exit of leaf-traces and
    the vascular axis would be exposed in the umbilicus. This
    explanation appears to me to be in harmony with the surface-features
    of Ulodendron scars on both Bothrodendron and
    Lepidodendron stems. The occasional occurrence of leaf-cushions
    on a portion of a Ulodendron scar is a difficulty on the
    cladoptosis hypothesis. Assuming that true leaf-cushions occur,
    their presence may, as Watson suggests, be due to the folding
    back of a piece of the outer cortex of the branch which has
    been “crushed down on to the area of the scar<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.”</p>

  <p>Since this account was written a note has been published
    by M. Renier<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> in which he describes a specimen of <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    from Liège, one face of which shows a projecting Ulodendroid
    scar with an excentric umbilicus. On the other face
    is a dichotomously branched shoot with surface-features corresponding
    to those on the scar; the evidence that the scar
    represents the base of the branch is described as indisputable.</p>

  <p>Stur<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> held the view that the depressions on Ulodendron stems
    represent the places of attachment of special shoots comparable
    with the bulbils of <i>Lycopodium Selago</i>, or, it may be added,
    with the short branches occasionally produced on <i>Cycas</i> stems.
    If the depressions were formed by the pressure of the bases
    of cones, it is clear that the size of the cavity must be an index
    of the diameter of the cone. The larger Ulodendron scars
    exceed in diameter the base of any known lepidodendroid strobilus.
    Another obvious difficulty, which has not been overlooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
    by Kidston who holds that the scars were produced by
    sessile cones, is that in <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> strobili were
    borne at the tips of slender branches; the same difficulty is
    presented by <i>Bothrodendron</i> (Fig. 213). It is unlikely that two
    types of strobili were produced on the same plant, particularly
    as the cone of <i>L. Veltheimianum</i> was heterosporous.</p>

  <p>The cones of certain species of <i>Pinus</i> remain attached to
    the tree for many years and their bases become embedded in
    the stem; this is particularly well shown in the drawing of a
    cone of <i>Pinus clausa</i> (<a href="#fig159">fig. 159</a>), for which I am indebted to
    Mr Sudworth, Dendrologist in the United States Forest Service.
    Mr Sudworth has drawn my attention to <i>P. attenuata</i> and <i>P.
    muricata</i> in illustration of the same phenomenon<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. The
    example shown in <a href="#fig159">fig. 159</a> cannot, however, be matched by any
    known specimen of <i>Ulodendron</i>; in the case of the depressions
    on the stem of a Pine the cone-base fits the circular scar,
    but in the fossil stems it is practically certain that this was
    not the case.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that certain Palaeozoic Lycopods
    shed their branches by a method similar to that employed by
    the Kauri Pine of New Zealand and by some species of Dicotyledons.
    The evidence adduced in the case of <i>Bothrodendron
      punctatum</i> is a strong argument in favour of extending the
    same explanation to other Ulodendron shoots.</p>

  <p>In 1883 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> described a specimen, now in the Leeds
    Museum, which convinced him that <i>Halonia</i> is merely a special
    form of <i>Lepidodendron</i> concerned with the production of fertile
    shoots or strobili. Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> also recognised that <i>Halonia</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span><i>regularis</i> is identical in the form of the cushions with the type
    known as <i>Lepidophloios laricinus</i>. It is worthy of note that
    under the name <i>Halonia</i>, Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> figured a piece of decorticated
    axis characterised by two rows instead of the usual
    spiral series of large cup-shaped scars. Recent researches have,
    however, tended to break down the distinction between <i>Ulodendron</i>
    and <i>Halonia</i> founded respectively on the biseriate
    and spiral arrangement of the scars or tubercles.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of Halonial branches as cone-bearing
    members of Lepidodendroid plants has passed into a generally
    accepted statement of fact, but, so far as I know, only one
    specimen has been figured in which strobili are seen attached
    to an Halonia axis. This specimen, described by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
    from the coal-field of Gard, is hardly sufficiently well-preserved
    to constitute a demonstration of the correctness of the generally
    received view, which, as is not unusual, has been repeated by
    one writer after another without due regard being paid to the
    nature of the evidence on which the statement is based. It
    may, indeed, be correct to describe Halonial branches as cone-bearing,
    but there are certain considerations which make one
    pause before unhesitatingly accepting this explanation. The
    vascular strand which passes from the central cylinder of the
    shoot to the tubercle or scar is composed of a solid rod of
    xylem distinguished from the main stele by the absence of a
    pith. In such petrified peduncles as have been discovered the
    stele is of the medullated type. The common occurrence of
    strobili terminating slender branches of lepidodendroid plants,
    though not a fatal objection to their attachment to Halonial
    shoots, shows that in many cases the cones were borne at the tip
    of leafy shoots. It may be that some of the Halonial scars are
    in origin like those of the Ulodendron axes of <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    and mark the position of deciduous vegetative branches.</p>

  <p>The first account of the anatomy of <i>Halonia</i> we owe to
    Dawes<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>; this was followed by a fuller description by Binney<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.
    The history of our knowledge of this type of branch has been
    given by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>, who expressed the opinion that Halonia
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>is merely a fertile condition of <i>Lepidophloios</i> and possibly of
    other lepidodendroid plants. He was also inclined to regard
    the Halonial tubercles as younger stages of the larger scars
    characteristic of the genus <i>Ulodendron</i>. Williamson’s contributions
    to our knowledge of <i>Halonia</i> are of primary importance;
    he supplied further proof of the Lepidodendroid nature of these
    branches and advanced our knowledge of their anatomy. In
    an early paper<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> he expressed the view that the differences on
    which <i>Halonia</i> and <i>Ulodendron</i> are separated are such as result
    from a difference in age and are not of generic importance.
    In the last memoir, of which he was sole author, published by
    the Royal Society<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>, Williamson brought forward further evidence
    in support of this well-founded opinion.</p>

  <p>That the fossils known as <i>Halonia</i> are branches of a
    lepidodendroid plant is at least certain, and it is probable that
    the lateral branches which they bore were fertile, though satisfactory
    proof of this is lacking. We know also that Halonia
    branches are characterised by the Lepidophloios form of leaf-cushion;
    there is, however, no sufficient reason to assume that
    such branches were never attached to stems with the cushions
    of the Lepidodendron form. The further question, namely
    whether Williamson was correct in his contention as to the
    absence of any essential distinction between <i>Ulodendron</i> and
    <i>Halonia</i>, does not admit of an unchallenged answer. In 1903
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> described the anatomy of a specimen of a biseriate
    <i>Halonia</i> branch of <i>Lepidophloios</i>. The form of the leaf-cushions
    is unfortunately not very well preserved, but Weiss figures
    other specimens with two rows of tubercles on which the leaf-cushions
    are sufficiently distinct to justify a comparison with
    those of <i>Lepidophloios</i>. He believes with Williamson that it is
    the presence of tubercles in place of scars which distinguishes
    <i>Halonia</i> from <i>Ulodendron</i>, and that the arrangement of the
    tubercles or scars is a matter of little importance. He expresses
    the opinion justified by the evidence available that the
    absence or presence of tubercles is merely due to accidents of
    preservation or, one may add, to difference in age. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
    dissents from Weiss’s description of his specimen as a biseriate
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span><i>Halonia</i>; he regards it as a Ulodendron branch of <i>Sigillaria
    discophora</i> (König). Until specimens with more clearly preserved
    external features are forthcoming it is impossible to
    settle the point in dispute, but on the facts before us there
    would seem to be a <i>prima facie</i> case in favour of Weiss’s
    contention.</p>

  <p>The designation <i>Halonia</i> may be retained as a descriptive
    term for Lepidodendroid shoots characterised by spirally disposed
    scars or tubercles and bearing leaf-cushions of the Lepidophloios
    type. In the case of specimens showing prominent
    tubercles, the superficial tissues are usually absent and, as in
    the fossil represented in <a href="#fig161">fig. 161</a>, the name <i>Halonia</i> does not
    necessarily imply the presence of leaf-cushions of a particular
    type.</p>

  <h4 id="Lepidodendron_shoots">vii. <i>Anatomical characters of Vegetative Lepidodendron shoots</i>
    (<i>Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios</i>).</h4>

  <p>The type already described under the name <i>Lepidodendron
    vasculare</i> differs from those dealt with in the following pages
    chiefly in the anatomy of the stele. The simplest and probably
    most primitive type of Lepidodendron stem is that in which
    the xylem forms a solid rod; the type of stele most frequently
    represented is that of <i>L. Harcourtii</i>, <i>L. fuliginosum</i>, and other
    species in which the diameter of the stele is greater and a
    cylinder of primary xylem encloses a comparatively large
    parenchymatous pith.</p>

  <h5 id="Lepidodendron_esnostense">1. <i>Lepidodendron esnostense</i>, Renault<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.</h5>

  <p>This species was founded by Renault on petrified specimens
    from the Culm beds of Esnost in France. The surface of a
    young twig bears prominent leaf-cushions of elongated rhomboidal
    form similar to those of <i>Lepidodendron obovatum</i>
    (<a href="#fig173">fig. 173</a>) and other species. In older branches the primary
    cortex is replaced by a considerable thickness of radially disposed
    secondary cortical tissue which, as shown in tangential
    section, consists of a reticulum of elongated pointed elements
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>with comparatively thick walls enclosing meshes filled with
    large-celled parenchyma. It is worthy of note that if such a
    branch were exposed to decay, the earlier destruction of the
    more delicate tissue in the meshes of the secondary cortex
    would produce a series of oval depressions, corresponding to
    the parenchymatous areas, separated by a projecting reticulum
    of the more resistant elements: a cast of this partially decayed
    surface would be indistinguishable from that of some types
    of <i>Sigillaria</i> or of a <i>Lyginodendron</i>. The inner regions of
    the cortex of the type-specimens have not been preserved.
    The xylem, which is the only part of the stele represented,
    has the form of a protostele or solid cylinder of scalariform
    tracheids with peripheral groups of narrower protoxylem elements
    which mark the points of exit of the leaf-traces: in a
    branch 1–2 cm. wide the xylem column has a diameter of
    3 mm. The small leaves (<a href="#fig143">fig. 143</a>, B, C), similar to those of a
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, are sub-rhomboidal in section near the base and
    approximately circular near the apex<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. The mesophyll consists
    of palisade cells having the appearance of typical chlorophyll-tissue.
    The heterosporous strobili attributed to this species bore
    microsporangia on the upper and megasporangia on the lower
    sporophylls; the megaspores, of which a considerable number
    occur in each megasporangium, are identical in size with those
    of another Culm form, <i>Lepidodendron rhodumnense</i>. Some of
    these have retained traces of prothallus tissue, and in one spore
    Renault figures what he regards as an archegonium: the
    drawing is by no means convincing.</p>

  <h5 id="L_rhodumnense">2. <i>Lepidodendron rhodumnense</i>, Renault<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</h5>

  <p>The species from the Culm of Combres (Loire) agrees in its
    solid xylem cylinder and in the differentiation of the secondary
    cortex, as also in the association of two kinds of spore, with
    <i>Lepidodendron esnostense</i>. A comparison of the leaves of the
    two types reveals certain differences which may be of specific
    rank, but, apart from minor differences, these Culm species
    may be classed under one anatomical type.</p>

  <p>This Devonian species was founded on a specimen
    3 × 2·5 cm. broad at the base, which shows the stumps of four
    branches recalling the dichotomously branched arms of <i>Stigmaria</i>
    and <i>Pleuromeia</i>. If these are in reality the remains of
    Stigmaria-like horizontal branches the species affords an
    interesting example of a Lepidodendron axis with a subterranean
    rhizome of the type which has been found in several
    Sigillarian stems. In the upper end of the axis the stele
    consists of a solid strand of xylem which is not sufficiently
    well preserved to show the position of the protoxylem groups.
    A transverse section taken near the base reveals a type of
    stele differing from that at the upper end in being composed
    of radially disposed tracheids and in its resemblance to the
    stele of <i>Stigmaria</i>.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> was proposed by
    Williamson in 1887 for petrified stems previously included by
    him in Witham’s species <i>L. Harcourtii</i>, but subsequently
    recognised as a distinct type characterised by “the greater uniformity
    in the composition of the entire cortex” and by other
    features some of which do not constitute distinctive characters.
    The species agrees with <i>L. Harcourtii</i> and with <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>
    in having a medullated stele; it is distinguished not
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>only by the more frequent preservation of the middle cortex, a
    fact due to a difference in minute structure, but chiefly by
    the peculiar structure of the secondary tissue added to the
    stele; this is in part composed of radial series of parenchymatous
    cells and of a varying amount of tracheal tissue the
    elements of which are narrower than in other species and are
    characterised also by their sinuous vertical course. As is pointed
    out in the sequel, the anatomical features of <i>L. fuliginosum</i>, as
    at present understood, are not confined to one type of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    stem. Specimens have been described with leaf-cushions
    of the form characteristic of <i>L. aculeatum</i>, <i>L. obovatum</i>
    and <i>Lepidophloios</i> combined with the anatomical features of
    Williamson’s species: it is possible that the two species
    <i>L. obovatum</i> and <i>L. aculeatum</i> are not really distinct<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>, but it is
    certain that shoots with both the <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Lepidophloios</i>
    cushions may have the same type of anatomical
    structure.</p>

  <p>A more detailed knowledge of the structural features of
    Lepidodendron shoots may enable us to define anatomical
    species with more exactness than is possible at present. There
    can, however, be little doubt that well-marked anatomical
    features may be associated with more than one specific form of
    shoot as defined by the form of the leaf-cushions.</p>

  <p>Solms-Laubach proposed the name <i>Lepidodendron Williamsoni</i>
    for the anatomical type <i>L. fuliginosum</i> of Williamson, but
    the latter name has been generally adopted.</p>

  <p>In the following account special attention is directed to the
    nature and origin of the secondary stelar tissue and to the
    secretory zone, as difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation
    of these features. Among the best examples of shoots
    of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> without secondary tissue or in
    which it is feebly developed are those originally described by
    Binney. The stele includes a large parenchymatous pith, the
    cells of which frequently show signs of recent division, a feature
    observed also in the pith of the large stem of <i>L. Wünschianum</i>,
    represented in figs. <a href="#fig181">181</a>, <a href="#fig182">182</a>. The primary xylem cylinder has
    an irregularly crenulate outer edge like that of <i>L. Wünschianum</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>and <i>L. Harcourtii</i> and the protoxylem elements occupy an
    exarch position. Isodiametric reticulately-pitted elements are
    met with both on the inner and outer edge of the xylem.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig162">162</a> and <a href="#fig163">163</a> illustrate the structure of the outer portion
    of the xylem and adjacent tissues in a section of a shoot
    3·8 cm. × 2·5 cm. in diameter, which is in the act of branching,
    as shown by the occurrence of two steles of equal size.
    A figure of the complete section will be found in Binney’s
    memoir<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>, and additional illustrations were published in 1899<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.</p>

      <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>. Leaf-trace. (Binney Collection, Cambridge.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The primary xylem (figs. <a href="#fig162">162</a>, <a href="#fig163">163</a>, <i>x</i>) is succeeded by 2–3
    rows of polygonal cells with dark contents and associated with
    isodiametric tracheae: these pass into clearer parenchymatous
    tissue, <i>a</i>, characterised by the arrangement of the cells in
    vertical series, to which the term meristematic zone has been
    applied. The secretory zone, <i>s</i>, abutting on the meristematic
    zone, consists of more or less disorganised parenchymatous cells
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>and broader and more elongated spaces; it is interrupted here
    and there by an outgoing leaf-trace, as at <i>lt</i> 1 and <i>lt</i> 2 in <a href="#fig162">fig. 162</a>.
    The secretory zone is succeeded by a homogeneous inner cortex
    like that described in <i>L. vasculare</i>; part of this region is seen
    at the upper edge of <a href="#fig162">fig. 162</a>. The broad middle cortex, which
    is separated from the inner cortex by a sharply defined
    boundary, is composed of rather small lacunar parenchymatous
    tissue consisting of sinuous tubular elements interspersed
    among isodiametric cells of various sizes (<a href="#fig166">fig. 166</a>, <i>p</i>). In
    the middle cortical region the leaf-traces pursue an almost
    horizontal course; one is shown in <a href="#fig164">fig. 164</a>, in oblique longitudinal
    section, in a reversed position; the xylem, <i>x</i>, should be
    on the inner side of the secretory tissue, <i>s</i>. The clear space
    between the two parts of the vascular bundle was originally
    occupied by a few layers of parenchymatous cells, as seen in the
    transverse sections, figs. <a href="#fig165">165</a> and <a href="#fig166">166</a>. In some specimens the
    leaf-traces pass through the middle cortex in a much more
    vertical course, as shown by the section represented in <a href="#fig165">fig. 165</a>.
    This section illustrates the structure of a typical leaf-trace with
    unusual clearness; it shows the tangentially elongated group of
    xylem, the strand of tissue which occupies the position of phloem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
    <i>s</i> (to which the term secretory zone is applied), the compact
    parenchyma between the two parts of the bundle, and surrounding
    the whole a narrow sheath sharply contrasted by the
    smaller and more uniform size of the cells from the middle
    cortex, a few cells of which are seen in the photograph. The
    middle cortex shows a well-defined junction with the more
    compact outer cortical region, which consists of primary
    parenchyma passing externally into a zone of phelloderm composed
    of thick-walled and more elongated cells. A noticeable
    feature in many Lepidodendron shoots is the occurrence of a
    circle of strands of secretory cells often surrounding fairly large
    ducts just internal to the edge of phelloderm: similar strands
    form irregularly concentric circles, as was pointed out in the
    case of <i>L. vasculare</i>, in the phelloderm itself.</p>

  <p>Fig. 166 shows a leaf-trace in the outer cortex accompanied
    by its crescent-shaped parichnos, <i>p</i>, derived from the middle
    cortex and by means of which the outer cortex and the lamina
    of the leaves are connected with the inner region of the shoot.
    This lacunar middle cortex and parichnos doubtless constitute an
    aerating tissue-system which after leaf-fall is exposed directly
    to the air at the ends of the parichnos arms on the leaf-scars.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

  <p>Some of the sections in the Binney Collection (Sedgwick
    Museum, Cambridge) show early stages in the production of
    secondary xylem: in the section represented in <a href="#fig167">fig. 167</a> the
    secretory zone is succeeded on its inner face by a zone of radially
    elongated cells, <i>m</i>, which are clearly in a meristematic condition.
    The same section shows also the more radially extended form
    of the xylem of a leaf-trace with its internal protoxylem, <i>px</i>, in
    contrast to the tangentially elongated form which is assumed
    during its passage through the cortex (cf. figs. <a href="#fig165"></a>165, <a href="#fig166">166</a>).</p>

  </div>

  <p>Some sections of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> in the Manchester
    University Collection are of special interest from the
    point of view of the method of secondary thickening. In
    the section reproduced in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, B, the meristematic zone
    is seen to consist in part of radially elongated elements, <i>m</i>,
    with parallel cross-walls evidently of recent origin. The same
    tissue is shown also in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, C, <i>a</i>, D, <i>a</i>, and in <a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, A, <i>a</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
    This band of meristem, which we may speak of as the cambium,
    occurs in the outer region of the meristematic zone immediately
    internal to the secretory zone, <i>sc</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig168">

  <p>The result of the activity of this cambium band is the
    production of secondary parenchyma and tracheal tissue. In
    <a href="#fig179">fig. 179</a>, E, drawn from a portion of the section represented in
    <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, B, a projecting arm of primary xylem is seen at <i>x</i>;
    this is followed by 2–3 layers of parenchymatous cells, some of
    which have dark contents, and beyond this is seen a group of
    secondary elements, <i>tr</i>, cut across somewhat obliquely, which
    are evidently products of the cambial cells on the inner margin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
    of the secretory zone, <i>sc</i>. The longitudinal section (<a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, D)
    shows the cambial cells, a, next the secretory zone, <i>sc</i>, passing
    internally into crushed and imperfectly preserved elongated
    elements which are presumably miniature tracheae, and these
    are succeeded by older and more completely lignified xylem
    elements, <i>x</i>. In larger shoots the amount of secondary tissue
    is considerably greater; it may consist almost entirely of short-celled
    parenchyma (<a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, C, from <i>x</i> to <i>sc</i>), or it may include
    a large proportion of radially disposed and vertically elongated
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>tracheae (<a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, D, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, and <a href="#fig170">fig. 170</a>, A, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>), or it may consist of

  <p>Fig. 169, A, is a diagrammatic sketch of the tissues—1 mm.

    The primary xylem is succeeded by short parenchymatous cells
    followed by a zone of radially elongated elements passing
    occasionally into rows of narrow scalariform tracheae, some of
    which, owing to their sinuous longitudinal course (<a href="#fig171">fig. 171</a>, C),
    are seen in oblique section, as at C, <a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, A. At its outer
    edge this secondary tissue, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, consisting of parenchyma and
    tracheae, passes into the cambial band (<a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, B, <i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The radial longitudinal section represented in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, C, is
    taken from the fossil described by Weiss as a biseriate <i>Halonia</i>;
    it agrees sufficiently closely in structure with others referred to
    <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> to be classed as an example of this
    anatomical type. A complete transverse section of the stem
    measures 9 × 6·3 cm.; the breadth of the tissues between the
    edge of the primary xylem and the outer edge of the secretory
    zone is 2·5 mm. The middle cortical region, characterised by
    the sooty appearance, which led Williamson to choose the
    specific name <i>fuliginosum</i>, is traversed by the leaf-traces and is
    sharply differentiated from both the inner and outer cortex.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>The longitudinal section (<a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, C) shows the outer edge of
    the primary xylem, <i>x</i>, abutting on a band of dark and small-celled
    parenchyma which passes into the broad zone of secondary
    tissue, <i>m</i>, the inner region of which consists of fairly thick-walled
    elements in radial series passing externally into the
    thin-walled cells of the cambial region, <i>a</i>, on the inner edge of
    the secretory zone, <i>sc</i>. This section shows also the interruption
    of the secretory zone by an outgoing leaf-trace, <i>lt</i>, the lower part
    of which, <i>sc</i>, is continued downwards into the secretory zone. The
    exit of a leaf-trace produces a gap in the secretory zone of the
    stem, but not in the xylem. If we applied the term phloem to the
    secretory zone—a course adopted by Prof. F. E. Weiss and some
    other authors, but which I do not propose to follow—we should
    speak of a phloem foliar-gap as a characteristic feature of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
    Lepidodendron shoot. This applies to other species of the
    genus as well as to <i>L. fuliginosum</i>.</p>

  <p>Fig. 171, A, shows more clearly the broad zone of secondary
    parenchyma with the thinner-walled cambial region, <i>a</i>; the latter
    is represented on a larger scale in <a href="#fig171">fig. 171</a>, B. The section
    shown in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, D, and in <a href="#fig170">fig. 170</a>, A, affords an example of a
    stem in which the secondary tissue consists largely of narrow
    scalariform tracheae, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>; the primary stele has a diameter of
    1 cm.; the secondary xylem, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, forms a fairly broad zone of
    parenchyma and tracheal elements through which leaf-traces
    pass vertically, a fact of some interest in comparison with the
    horizontal course which they pursue through the medullary rays
    in the normal secondary wood of <i>L. vasculare</i> and <i>L. Wünschianum</i>.
    The secondary tracheae pass gradually into thin-walled
    cambial cells (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, D; 170, A) with parallel tangential
    walls. Fig. 171, C, shows the sinuous course of the secondary
    tracheae as seen in longitudinal section, and a few small
    groups of parenchymatous cells, <i>mr</i>, which may be of the nature
    of medullary rays, enclosed between the winding scalariform
    tracheae.</p>

  <p>The secretory zone of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> agrees

    large clear spaces which characterise this tissue, as seen
    in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>, B, appear to owe their origin to groups of small
    cells which gradually break down and give rise to spaces containing
    remnants of the disorganised elements, as in <a href="#fig171">fig. 171</a>, D,
    and <a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, B, <i>b</i>. The secretory tissue seen in <a href="#fig170">fig. 170</a>, B,
    consists of large and small parenchymatous cells without any of
    the broad sacs or spaces such as are shown in <a href="#fig169">fig. 169</a>, C.</p>

  <p>Fig. 172 represents a diagrammatic sketch of a transverse
    section (4 × 3·4 cm. in diameter) of a young shoot from the
    Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> in
    1881 as <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii</i>. It shows the features
    characteristic of <i>L. fuliginosum</i> and is of importance as affording
    an example of a shoot giving off a branch from the stele to
    supply a lateral axis of the type characteristic of <i>Halonia</i>. The
    exit of the branch-stele forms a gap in the main stele; a
    ramular gap as distinguished from a foliar gap. The outgoing
    vascular strand is at first crescentic, but becomes gradually
    converted into a solid stele. The primary xylem of the main
    stele (black in the figure) consists of a ring six tracheae in
    breadth; this is succeeded by a few layers of dark parenchymatous
    cells and a band of radially elongated elements, <i>a</i>, which
    abuts on the secretory zone. The middle lacunar cortex, <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>,
    with <i>Stigmaria</i> rootlets, <i>s</i>, is fairly well preserved. In the outer
    cortex occur several leaf-traces, <i>lt</i>, accompanied by spaces originally
    occupied by the parichnos strand, <i>p</i>. A band of secondary
    cortex, consisting chiefly of phelloderm, is seen at <i>pd</i>. The

  <p>It remains to consider the external characters of Lepidodendroid
    shoots possessing the anatomical features represented
    by the comprehensive species <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>.</p>

  <p>Certain sections exhibiting this type of structure were
    described by Binney in 1872 as <i>Halonia regularis</i><a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> on evidence
    supplied by Mr Dawes, who stated that they were cut from a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>specimen bearing Halonia tubercles. The section represented
    in <a href="#fig172">fig. 172</a> is no doubt from an Halonia axis. In 1890 Cash
    and Lomax<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> stated that they had in their possession a stem of
    the <i>L. fuliginosum</i> type with the external features of <i>Lepidophloios</i>;
    this identification has been confirmed by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
    and Weiss<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. It is, however, equally clear that certain species
    with the elongated leaf-cushions of <i>Lepidodendron</i> must be
    included among examples of shoots with the anatomical
    characters of <i>L. fuliginosum</i>.</p>

  <p>Dr Scott<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> published in 1906 a short account of the structure
    of a specimen from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire, the
    external features of which were identified by Kidston with
    those of <i>Lepidodendron obovatum</i> Sternb. Dr Scott generously
    allowed me to have drawings made from his specimen; these
    are reproduced in <a href="#fig173">fig. 173</a>. The form of the leaf-cushion is by
    no means perfect; there is a well-marked median ridge, and
    the small circular scar near the upper end of some of the
    cushions may represent the ligular cavity. At the base of the
    leaf-cushions a cortical meristem has produced a zone of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>secondary cortex; at <i>c</i> a second meristem is seen in the outer
    cortex: the dark dots in the cortex mark the positions of leaf-trace
    bundles. The inner cortex, <i>d</i>, is a more compact tissue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
    surrounding the imperfectly preserved secretory zone. From
    the medullated stele a lateral branch, <i>b</i>, is being given off; its
    crescentic form becoming changed to circular as it passes nearer
    to the surface.</p>

    type of anatomy with a true <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The
    locality of the specimen is not known. The leaf-cushions
    are 1·5 cm. long with tapered upper and lower ends; a ligular
    cavity may be recognised on some parts of the fossil, also faint
    indications of leaf-trace scars. The tubercles (<a href="#fig174">fig. 174</a>, A–C, <i>t</i>)
    probably represent leaf-traces which the shrinkage of the superficial
    tissues has rendered visible in the lower part of their
    course. The circular scar, <i>s</i> (fig. B), on the partially decorticated
    surface is apparently a wound. The stele is sufficiently
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>well preserved to justify its reference to <i>L. fuliginosum</i>. The
    irregularly crenulated edge of the primary xylem, <i>x</i> (<a href="#fig175">fig. 175</a>), is
    succeeded by a broad band of parenchyma (the meristematic
    zone), <i>m</i>, and beyond this are remnants of the secretory zone, <i>s</i>.
    The structure of the leaf-traces corresponds with that of other
    specimens of the type, but the much steeper course of these
    vascular strands, <i>lt</i>, <i>lt′</i> (<a href="#fig176">fig. 176</a>), is a feature in which this
    example differs from most of those referred to <i>L. fuliginosum</i>.
    Such evidence as is available would seem to point to the
    absence of trustworthy criteria enabling us to separate, on
    anatomical grounds, <i>Lepidophloios</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

  <h6><i>Stigmaria radiculosa</i> (Hick).</h6>

  <p>We have no proof of the nature of the subterranean organs of
    <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>, though it is not improbable that the
    specimens described below may be correctly assigned by Weiss
    to that species. Prof. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> has made an interesting contribution
    to our knowledge of a type first described by Hick<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> under
    the name <i>Tylophora radiculosa</i>, a designation which he afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
    altered to <i>Xenophyton radiculosum</i><a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and for which we may
    now substitute <i>Stigmaria radiculosa</i> (Hick). Prof. Williamson
    expressed the opinion that <i>Xenophyton</i> exhibited considerable
    affinity with <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> and Weiss’s further study of the
    species leads him to regard Hick’s plant as probably the Stigmarian
    organ of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>. The diagrammatic
    transverse section represented in <a href="#fig177">fig. 177</a>, A (4·5 cm. in diameter),
    shows an outer cortex of parenchyma, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>, consisting in part of
    radial rows of secondary tissue and of a band of compact parenchyma
    bounded by the wavy line <i>a</i>; at <i>sc</i> is a series of secretory
    strands exactly like those in a corresponding position in <i>Lepidodendron
    fuliginosum</i> and other species of the genus. The greater
    part of the organ is occupied by a lacunar and hyphal middle
    cortex identical in structure with that shown in <a href="#fig178">fig. 178</a>, B, drawn
    from a rootlet. At <i>d</i>, <a href="#fig177">fig. 177</a>, A, the middle cortex has been
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>invaded by a narrow tongue of outer cortical tissue. The stele
    is characterised by a large pith filled with parenchyma; in <i>Stigmaria
    ficoides</i><a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> the general absence of pith-tissue has led to the
    inference that the stele was hollow. The xylem is represented by
    a ring of bundles separated by broad medullary rays; each bundle
    contains a few small, apparently primary, elements on its inner
    edge but is mainly composed of radial rows of secondary tracheae
    <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, <a href="#fig177">fig. 177</a>, B. On the outer face of the secondary xylem occur a
    few smaller and thinner walled cells, <i>c</i>, having the appearance
    of meristematic tissue; from these additional tracheae were
    added to the xylem. This meristematic zone occurs, as in the
    stems of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, immediately internal to the secretory
    tissue, sc; at <i>c</i><sup>1</sup>, <a href="#fig177">fig. 177</a>, B, is seen the inner cortical tissue.</p>

      <i>Rootlet of Stigmaria.</i> (From a section in the Manchester Collection.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>In surface-view a specimen figured by Hick<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> shows a number
    of circular scars agreeing in shape and arrangement with the
    rootlet scars of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>. At <i>b</i> in <a href="#fig177">fig. 177</a>, A, the basal
    portion of a rootlet is shown in organic connexion with the outer
    cortex. The rootlet-bundles are given off from the stele as in
    other examples of <i>Stigmaria</i>; each bundle consists of a triangular
    strand of xylem with an endarch protoxylem at the narrow end
    accompanied by a portion of the secretory tissue as in the
    leaf-traces. As in <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> the rootlets are attached
    to the outer cortex above a cushion of small cells. It is interesting
    to find that rootlet-bundles, as seen in tangential section
    of the main axis, are associated with a parichnos strand, but
    this is on the xylem side of the vascular strand, whereas in the
    case of leaf-traces the parichnos is on the other side of the
    bundle.</p>

  <p>Fig. 178, A, represents a transverse section of a rootlet
    (6 mm. in diameter) associated with <i>Stigmaria radiculosa</i> and
    probably belonging to this species. The xylem strand <i>x</i> is composed
    of a group of tracheae with a single protoxylem strand,
    <i>px</i>, at the pointed end and with small metaxylem elements at
    the broad end next the space originally occupied by the so-called
    phloem. A parenchymatous sheath, <i>c′</i>, surrounds the
    bundle, and beyond this is the broad middle cortex, a small
    portion of which is shown on a larger scale in <a href="#fig178">fig. 178</a>, B; as Weiss
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>points out, some of the outermost cells of the lacunar cortex
    (<i>m</i>) are clearly in a state of meristematic activity.</p>

  <p>The preservation of the middle cortex and the small quantity
    of secondary xylem are characters which this <i>Stigmaria</i>
    shares with <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>, and although decisive
    evidence is still to seek, we may express the opinion that
    Weiss’s surmise of a connexion between <i>Stigmaria radiculosa</i>
    and <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> is probably correct.</p>

  <h5 id="L_Harcourtii">5. <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii.</i> Fig. 179, A–D.</h5>

  <p>In 1831 Mr Witham<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> published an anatomical description of
    a fragment of a <i>Lepidodendron</i> which he named <i>Lepidodendron
    Harcourtii</i> after Mr C. G. V. Vernon Harcourt from whom the
    specimen was originally obtained. The fossil was found in rocks
    belonging to the Calciferous series in Northumberland. Witham
    reproduced the account of this species in his classic work
    on <i>Fossil Vegetables</i><a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>, and Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>, who examined
    Mr Harcourt’s material, published a description of it in their
    <i>Fossil Flora</i> in which they expressed the view that <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    is intermediate between Conifers and Lycopods. Adolphe
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> included in his memoir on <i>Sigillaria elegans</i> an
    account of Witham’s species based on material presented to the
    Paris Museum by Mr Hutton and Robert Brown. Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
    has shown that the actual transverse section figured by Witham
    is now in the York Museum; a piece of stem in the same
    Museum, which is not the specimen from which Witham’s
    section was cut, supplied the transverse section figured by
    Brongniart. The figures given by Lindley and Hutton do not
    appear to have been made from the York specimens. In 1887
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> published a note in which he pointed out that some
    of the specimens described by him as <i>L. Harcourtii</i> should be
    transferred to a distinct species, which he named <i>L. fuliginosum</i>.
    Subsequently in 1893 he gave a fuller account of Witham’s
    species; it has, however, been shown by Dr Kidston and by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>Mr Watson<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> that certain specimens identified by Williamson as
    <i>L. Harcourtii</i> differ sufficiently from that type to be placed in
    another species, for which Watson proposes the name <i>L. Hickii</i>.</p>

  <p>A paper on <i>L. Harcourtii</i> published by Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> in 1891
    extends our knowledge of this type in regard to several anatomical
    details. It was recognised by Williamson that the
    absence of secondary wood in shoots possessing the anatomical
    characters of <i>L. Harcourtii</i> is a feature to which no great
    importance should be attached. It is possible that the large
    stems from the Isle of Arran described by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> as
    <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i>, in which the secondary wood is
    well developed, may be specifically identical with the smaller
    specimens from Northumberland and elsewhere which are recognised
    as examples of Witham’s type.</p>

  <p>The diagrammatic sketch shown in <a href="#fig179">fig. 179</a>, A, was made from
    a section figured by Williamson in 1893<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>; it has a diameter of
    9 × 8·5 cm. The stele is of the medullated type like that of
    <i>L. Wünschianum</i>, and the outer edge of the primary xylem is
    characterised by sharp and prominent projecting ridges similar
    to those of <i>L. fuliginosum</i> but rather more prominent. Parenchymatous
    cells succeed the xylem, as in other species, but in
    this case there is no indication of meristematic activity; beyond
    this region occur occasional patches of a partially destroyed
    secretory zone. Remains of a lacunar tissue are seen in the
    middle cortical region; also numerous leaf-traces, <i>lt</i>, consisting
    of a tangentially elongated xylem strand accompanied by a
    strand of secretory zone tissue enclosed in a sheath of delicate
    parenchyma. In the inner part of the outer cortex, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>, the leaf-traces
    lie in a space originally occupied by the parichnos; in
    the outer portion of the same region a band of secondary
    cortex, <i>pd</i>, has been formed; immediately internal to this
    occur numerous patches of secretory tissue, represented by small
    dots in the drawing close to <i>pd</i>; one is shown on a larger scale
    in fig. B.</p>

  <p>The position of the phellogen is seen at <i>a</i>; external to this
    are radial rows of rather large cells with dark contents.</p>

  <p>Fig. 179, C, <i>x</i>, shows the characteristic form of the primary
    xylem edge, beyond which are seen oval or circular leaf-traces
    with a mesarch protoxylem, <i>lt</i>, <i>px</i>. It is possible that this
    specimen may not be specifically identical with Witham’s species,
    but it represents a very similar if not identical type; it may on
    the other hand be referable to <i>L. fuliginosum</i>. The importance
    of the specimen, apart from its precise specific position, is that
    it serves to illustrate the general appearance of the xylem
    surface met with in both species, <i>L. Harcourtii</i> and <i>L. fuliginosum</i>.
    A tangential longitudinal section, taken through the
    line <i>ab</i> in fig. C, is represented in <a href="#fig179">fig. 179</a>, D. The xylem of
    the leaf-traces <i>lt</i>, consisting chiefly of scalariform tracheae,
    alternates with patches of crushed and delicate parenchyma which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
    immediately abut on the primary xylem; at <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, the section
    passes through some of the projecting arms of the xylem
    cylinder; at <i>m</i> is seen a patch of meristematic zone tissue.
    This section together with the similar section of <i>Lepidodendron
    vasculare</i> described on a previous page demonstrates that
    the projecting ridges of the primary xylem form apparently
    vertical bands: they are not characterised by a lattice-work
    arrangement as described by Bertrand and by other authors
    who have accepted his conclusions. If a reticulum of intersecting
    ridges were present on the face of the xylem cylinder its
    existence would be revealed by such a section as that represented
    in <a href="#fig179">fig. 179</a>, D.</p>

  <h5 id="L_Wünschianum">6. <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i> (Williamson). <a href="#fig180">Figs. 180–184</a>.</h5>

  <p>Reference was made in Volume I. to the occurrence of large
    stems of a Lepidodendron in volcanic beds of Calciferous sandstone
    age in the island of Arran<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. These were discovered and
    briefly described by Mr Wünsch in 1867<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> and afterwards named
    by Carruthers <i>Lomatophloyos Wünschianus</i><a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. Mr Carruthers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>visited the locality and published an account of the peculiar
    method of preservation of the plant remains<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. It is, however, to
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that we owe the more complete description of these
    Arran stems. Portions of large stems from the Arran beds are
    preserved in the British Museum, the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge,
    and in the Manchester Museum. The section of one
    of these is shown in <a href="#fig180">fig. 180</a>; an outer shell of bark encloses a
    mass of volcanic ash in which are embedded several woody
    cylinders originally described as “internal piths<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>,” and by Carruthers
    as young stems produced from spores which had germinated
    in the hollow trunk of a large tree. The true interpretation was
    supplied by Williamson who showed that a stem of the dimensions
    of that represented by the outer cortex, <i>e</i>, <a href="#fig180">fig. 180</a>, must have
    possessed a single stele of the size of those seen in the interior
    of the hollow trunk. The additional woody cylinders, or steles,
    were derived from other stems, and carried, probably by water,
    into the partially decayed trunk. In addition to large Lepidodendron
    stems Williamson described smaller shoots as well
    as an Halonial branch and made brief reference to some
    cones described by Binney<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> in 1871 from the same locality.</p>

  <p>The following account of <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i> is
    based on an exceptionally fine specimen discovered by Mr T.
    Kerr of Edinburgh in Calciferous sandstone volcanic ashes at
    Dalmeny in Linlithgowshire. The material from this locality
    described by Mr Hill and myself<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> was generously placed in my
    hands by Dr Kidston of Stirling. Fig. 181, A, shows a
    transverse section, 33 cm. in diameter, consisting of a shell of
    outer cortical tissue enclosing a core of light-coloured volcanic
    ash; on the decay of the more delicate middle cortex the cylindrical
    stele dropped to one side of the hollow trunk. The stele,
    <a href="#fig182">fig. 182</a>, has a diameter of 6·5 cm.; the centre is occupied by
    concentric layers of silica, <i>s</i>, surrounded externally by the
    remains of a parenchymatous pith, <i>p</i>, made up of isodiametric
    and sinuous hypha-like elements like those in the middle cortex
    of Lepidodendron shoots. On the inner edge of the primary
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>xylem, <i>x′</i>, occur several isodiametric tracheae with fine scalariform
    and reticulate thickening bands like those in the central region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
    of the stele of <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>: it is probable that these
    elements are vestiges of conducting tissue which in ancestral
    forms formed a solid and not a medullated stele.</p>

  <p>The primary xylem is limited externally by an unequally
    fluted surface with exarch protoxylem elements; it is, however,
    noteworthy that there is not always a very clearly defined
    difference between the small protoxylem and the large centripetally
    developed tracheae. Immediately beyond the primary
    xylem occur numerous thin-walled parenchymatous cells with
    spiral and reticulate pitting; beyond these is the broad zone of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
    secondary xylem, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, composed of scalariform tracheae and
    numerous medullary rays consisting of one, two, or several rows
    of radially elongated elements with spiral and reticulate pitting.
    In tangential sections the rays are seen to vary considerably
    in size, some being made up of a single row of cells while others
    are longer and broader; through the latter leaf-traces pass
    horizontally. Portions of medullary rays are seen at <i>mr</i> in
    <a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, C and E.</p>

  <p>The leaf-traces given off from projecting ridges on the outer
    edge of the primary xylem pass upwards for a short distance
    and then bend outwards through a broad medullary ray; on
    reaching the limit of the secondary xylem they again bend
    sharply upwards, appearing in transverse section at <i>lt</i> <a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, B.
    Each leaf-trace consists at first of long tracheae accompanied by
    numerous thin-walled spiral and reticulate parenchymatous cells
    derived from the tissue in contact with the outer edge of the
    primary wood. Fig. 181, B, shows a leaf-trace near the edge of
    the secondary xylem; it consists of a group of primary tracheae,
    with narrower protoxylem elements, <i>px</i>, near the outer margin,
    almost completely enclosed by radially disposed series of smaller
    and more delicate tracheae. These secondary elements of the
    leaf-trace are apparently added during its passage through
    the medullary ray, but additions are also made to this tissue
    by the meristematic zone, <i>m</i>, <a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, B and E. In contact
    with the outermost tracheae of normal size at the edge of the
    secondary xylem there are some smaller lignified elements, as
    at <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, E, and at T, <a href="#fig183">fig. 183</a>; this juxtaposition of large
    and small tracheae has been referred to in the description of
    <i>L. vasculare</i>.</p>

  <p>Prof. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, in his account of the Arran specimens of
    this species, expressed the opinion that the trees probably
    perished “in consequence of the mephitic vapours which filled
    the atmosphere”; it maybe that in the striking difference in the
    diameter of the conducting elements on the margin of the wood
    we have evidence of approaching death.</p>

  <p>Beyond the most recently formed tracheae we have a band
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>of delicate parenchymatous cells (<i>m</i>, <a href="#fig181">figs. B and E, 181</a>; C, figs.
    183, 184) forming the meristematic zone<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. The longitudinal
    section represented in <a href="#fig184">fig. 184</a> shows some recently formed narrow
    tracheae, T, and beyond these the meristematic zone composed of
    thin-walled short cells, C, arranged in horizontal rows. It is this
    small-celled tissue to which the name phloem has been applied
    by some authors<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>, a term which seems to me to be misleading
    and inappropriate. In passing through this zone of dividing cells
    the leaf-traces become surrounded by an arc of meristem from
    which elements are added to the radially placed rows of secondary
    tracheae. Beyond the meristematic region portions of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>secretory zone are preserved, consisting of large sacs or spaces
    and small dark cells as seen in figs. <a href="#fig181">181</a>, B, E, <i>sc</i>, F; <a href="#fig183">183</a>, <a href="#fig184">184</a>.
    This tissue has the same structure as in <i>L. vasculare</i> and in
    <i>L. fuliginosum</i>: it is a striking fact that there are no indications
    of any additions to the secretory zone even in stems with such
    a large amount of secondary xylem as in the Dalmeny specimen
    (<a href="#fig182">fig. 182</a>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>). If the secretory zone were of the nature of phloem
    we should expect to see signs of additions made to it in the
    course of growth. In this connexion it is worth mentioning
    that in the recent fern <i>Botrychium</i> (Ophioglossaceae) secondary
    xylem is formed in the stem, but apparently no additions are
    made to the phloem. The structure of the secretory zone tissue
    as seen in the longitudinal section <a href="#fig184">fig. 184</a>, S, is also a serious
    difficulty in the way of accepting the designation phloem as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
    employed by Scott and Weiss. Between the secretory zone and
    the outer cortical region, no tissues have been preserved. The
    shell of bark consists chiefly of radial rows of elongated cells
    with rather thick walls characterised by the occurrence of small
    intercellular spaces and by tangentially placed bands of secretory
    cells and sacs (<a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, D, <i>s</i>). Immediately internal to the
    secondary cortex or phelloderm occur groups of secretory tissue

  </div>

  <p>The large tree shown in transverse section in <a href="#fig181">fig. 181</a>, A,
    has lost its leaf-cushions; the bark, as seen in the lower
    part of the photograph, presents a fissured appearance like
    that with which we are familiar on an old Oak or Elm stem.
    A radial longitudinal section through the phelloderm revealed
    the existence of a crushed leaf-trace passing outwards in an
    approximately horizontal course accompanied by a strand of
    parenchymatous tissue<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> having the characteristic structure of a
    parichnos. It is probable that the surface of this partially
    decorticated stem differed in appearance from that of an old
    <i>Sigillaria</i> (cf. <a href="#fig198">fig. 198</a>) in the much smaller and less conspicuous
    parichnos strands.</p>

  <p>In addition to the large stems of <i>L. Wünschianum</i> from
    Arran and Dalmeny numerous examples of smaller axes from
    the former locality are represented in the Williamson collection
    (British Museum). Some of the twigs are characterised by a
    solid stele (protostele) giving off numerous leaf-traces accompanied
    by short spirally thickened tracheids like those which
    occur at the outer edge of the primary xylem in the larger stem:
    these extend into the leaf where they are arranged round the
    vascular bundle like the transfusion tracheids<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in many recent
    conifers. The surface of these smaller shoots bears large leaf-cushions
    which are seen in longitudinal section to have the form
    characteristic of <i>Lepidophloios</i>. It is worthy of note that a
    section of a bifurcating axis of this species from the Calciferous
    Sandstone of Craigleith (British Museum Collection<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>), although its
    diameter is 19 × 14 cm., shows no signs of secondary wood. This
    late appearance of secondary xylem and other anatomical features
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>suggest the possibility of the specific identity of <i>L. Wünschianum</i>
    and <i>L. Harcourtii</i><a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.</p>

  <p>In 1871 Binney<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> described a specimen of a heterosporous cone,
    <i>Lepidostrobus Wünschianus</i>, from Arran exhibiting the ordinary
    features of lepidodendroid strobili; this was probably borne by
    <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="L_macrophyllum">7. <i>Lepidodendron macrophyllum</i> (Williamson). Fig. 186, C.</h5>

  <p>The diagrammatic sketch reproduced in <a href="#fig186">fig. 186</a>, C, was
    made from the transverse section of a small twig, slightly
    less than 2 cm. in its longest diameter, originally figured by
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> in 1872. Earlier in the same year Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> published
    a short account of the same form based on specimens
    collected by Mr Butterworth from the Coal-Measures of
    Lancashire near Oldham, but both authors refrained from instituting
    a new specific name. In a later publication Williamson
    spoke of the type as <i>Lepidodendron macrophyllum</i><a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. Williamson’s
    species has nothing to do with <i>Lycopodites macrophyllus</i> of
    Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. The most striking feature of this rare form is
    the large size of the leaf-cushions, which are of the <i>Lepidophloios</i>
    type, in proportion to the diameter of the shoot. The stele
    consists of a ring of xylem, all of which is primary in the sections
    so far described, enclosing a parenchymatous pith: a Stigmarian
    rootlet is shown at <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>The above list may serve to call attention to a few synonyms<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
    of this plant, and to a selection of sources from which full
    information may be obtained as to the history of our knowledge
    of this characteristic and widely spread Lower Carboniferous
    type.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> is represented by casts of
    stems, the largest of which hitherto described reaches a length
    of 5·22 metres with a maximum diameter of 63 cm.; this
    specimen, figured by Stur<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>, consists of a tapered main axis
    giving off smaller lateral shoots, some of which exhibit dichotomous
    branching. Fig. 185, C and D, represent the external
    features of a well-preserved cast and impression respectively.
    Oblique rows of prominent cushions wind round the surface of
    the stem and branches: each cushion is prolonged upwards and
    downwards in the form of a narrow ridge with sloping sides
    which connects adjacent cushions by an ogee curve. At
    the upper limit of the broader kite-shaped portion of the
    cushion the ligular pit forms a conspicuous feature; immediately
    below this is the leaf-scar with its three small scars,—the
    lateral parichnos strands and the central leaf-trace. The
    two oval areas shown in <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, D, just below the lower edge
    of the leaf-scars, represent the parichnos arms which impinge
    on the surface of the cushions on their way to the leaves, as
    explained on a previous page. It is possible that these areas
    were visible on the living stem as strands of loose parenchyma
    comparable with the lenticel-like pits on the stipules of
    <i>Angiopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and the leaf-bases of Cyatheaceous ferns, or it
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>may be that their prominence in the specimen before us is the
    result of the decay of a thin layer of superficial cortex which hid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
    them on the living tree. Fig. 185, B, illustrates the appearance of
    a stem in a partially decorticated condition (<i>Bergeria</i> state).
    A further degree of decortication is seen in <a href="#fig185">fig. 185</a>, A, which
    represents the <i>Knorria</i> condition.</p>

      <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum.</i> From specimens in Dr Kidston’s Collection. (Approximately nat. size.)</div>
  </div>

  <p><a href="#fig157">Fig. 157</a> shows a Ulodendron axis of this species; in the
    lower part the specimen illustrates the partial obliteration of
    the surface features as the result of the splitting of the
    outer bark consequent on growth in thickness of the tree.
    By an extension of the cracks, shown in an early stage in
    <a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a>, the leaf-cushions would be entirely destroyed and the
    surface of the bark would be characterised by longitudinal
    fissures simulating the vertical grooves and ridges of a Sigillarian
    stem. The large stumps of trees shown in the frontispiece
    to Volume I. are probably, as Kidston<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> suggests, trunks
    of <i>L. Veltheimianum</i> in which the leaf-cushions have been
    replaced by irregular longitudinal fissures. In old stems of
    <i>Sigillaria</i> the enlarged parichnos areas constitute a characteristic
    feature (p. 205), but it does not follow that the absence of large
    parichnos scars is a distinguishing feature of all <i>Lepidodendra</i>.</p>

  <p>In this species, as in others, the form of the leaf-cushion
    exhibits a considerable range of variation dependent on the
    thickness of the shoot; the contiguous cushions of young
    branches become stretched apart as the result of increasing
    girth of the whole organ, and casts of still older branches may
    exhibit very different surface-features<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. The leaves as seen
    on impressions of slender branches are comparatively short,
    reaching a length of 1–2 cm. It is important to notice that
    leafy twigs of this species may bear terminal cones<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> resembling
    in form those of <i>Picea excelsa</i> and other recent conifers, though
    differing essentially in their morphological features.</p>

  <p>The fossil stumps of trees represented in the frontispiece to
    Volume I. bear horizontally spreading and dichotomously
    branched root-like organs having the characters of <i>Stigmaria
    ficoides</i><a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. Geinitz has suggested that <i>Stigmaria inaequalis</i>
    Göpp. may be the underground portion of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

  <p>It is unfortunately seldom possible to connect petrified
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> cones with particular species of the genus based
    on purely vegetative characters, but it is practically certain
    that we are justified in recognising certain strobili described
    by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> from the Calciferous Sandstone series of Burntisland
    on the Firth of Forth as those of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>.
    Williamson believed that the cone which he
    described belonged to the plant with shoots characterised by the
    anatomical features of his species <i>Lepidodendron brevifolium</i>
    (= <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>), a conclusion which is confirmed by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.
    The cone of <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>, which reached a diameter of
    at least 1 cm. and a length of 4 cm., agrees in essentials with
    other species of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>; the axis has a single medullated
    stele of the same general type as that of the vegetative shoots
    of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> and <i>L. Harcourtii</i>. The sporophylls
    are described by Williamson as spirally disposed, and
    Scott notices that in some specimens they are arranged in
    alternate whorls; as in recent Lycopods both forms of phyllotaxis
    may occur in the same species. The heterosporous nature
    of this strobilus, to which Scott first applied the name <i>Lepidostrobus
    Veltheimianus</i>, is clearly demonstrated by the two
    longitudinal sections contributed by Mr Carruthers and figured
    by Williamson in 1893<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

  <p>Each sporophyll, attached almost at right angles to the
    cone-axis, bears a radially elongated sporangium seated on the
    median line of its upper face; its margins are laterally expanded
    as a thin lamina; from the middle of the lower face a
    narrow keel extends downwards between two sporangia belonging
    to a lower series. From the base of a sporangium a mass of
    sterile tissue penetrates into the spore-producing region as in
    the large sporangia of <i>Isoetes</i> (cf. <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, H, <i>a</i>, and <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, H).
    The distal and free portion of the sporophylls is bent upwards
    as a protecting bract. Some of the sporangia in the upper
    part of the cone produced numerous microspores, while 8–16
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>megaspores occur in the lower sporangia. The megaspores,
    having a mean diameter of 0·8 mm. “quite 40 times the size of the
    microspores<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>,” are characterised by tubular capitate appendages,
    and by a conspicuous three-lobed projection (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, E)<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> which,
    as Scott suggests, may represent the outer spore-wall which
    has split as the result of germination. It is not improbable,
    as shown in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, I, that this cap was present
    before germination. The megaspores represented in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, I,
    illustrate their characteristic form as seen in a section
    of a megasporangium, <i>Sm</i>; the open beak-like portion of the
    larger spore is probably the apical region which has split along
    the three-rayed lines. These lines form a characteristic feature of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>both recent and extinct spores and denote their origin in
    tetrads. The spore shown in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, E<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, illustrates the external
    features. The apical region of the prothallus of a megaspore
    of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> described by Mr Gordon<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
    consists of smaller cells than those occupying the greater part
    of the spore-cavity, a differentiation which he compares with
    that of the prothallus of <i>Selaginella</i>.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the petrified shoots described
    by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> from the Calciferous Sandstone beds of Burntisland
    as <i>Lepidodendron brevifolium</i> are identical with specimens
    possessing the external features of <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>. In 1872
    Dawson expressed the opinion that Williamson’s species should
    be referred to <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>, and evidence subsequently
    obtained confirms this view. The stele of this species is of
    the medullated type, differing from that of <i>L. fuliginosum</i> and
    <i>L. Harcourtii</i> in the absence of prominent ridges on the external
    surface of the primary xylem, and from <i>L. vasculare</i> in the
    possession of a parenchymatous pith. In younger twigs the
    cortex consists of fairly homogeneous tissue, but in older
    branches there is a greater distinction between a delicate
    middle cortex and a stronger outer cortex. Fig. 186, A,
    represents a stem in which the vascular cylinder is composed
    of a primary xylem ring, <i>x</i>, 1·5 mm. broad, succeeded by
    a zone of secondary wood 1·2 cm. in breadth. The junction
    between the primary and secondary xylem is shown on a larger
    scale in <a href="#fig186">fig. 186</a>, B. The tissues abutting on the secondary
    xylem have not been preserved; the outer cortex, which
    consists chiefly of secondary elements, is divided superficially
    into unequal ridges corresponding to the leaf-cushions which
    have been more or less obliterated as the result of growth
    in thickness of the stem.</p>

  <h5 id="L_Pedroanum">9. <i>Lepidodendron Pedroanum</i> (Carruthers).</h5>

  <p>In 1869 Mr Carruthers described some specimens of vegetative
    stems and isolated sporangia, collected by Mr Plant in
    Brazil, as <i>Flemingites Pedroanus</i><a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. From a more recent account
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>published by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> it is clear that Carruthers’ species is a
    true <i>Lepidodendron</i>; an examination of the type-specimens in
    the British Museum confirms this determination. The contiguous
    leaf-cushions have rounded angles similar in form
    to those of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> and <i>L. dichotomum</i>,
    but it is not unlikely that the Brazilian plant is specifically
    distinct from European species. A figure of one of the specimens
    on which Carruthers founded the species is given by Arber<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> in
    his <i>Glossopteris Flora</i>. The Brazilian plant is chiefly interesting
    as affording proof of the existence of <i>Lepidodendron</i> in the
    southern hemisphere; the species has also been recognised
    in South Africa from material collected by Mr Leslie at
    Vereeniging<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.</p>

  <p>As Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> has suggested, it is not improbable that the
    fossils described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> from Brazil as <i>Lycopodiopsis
    Derbyi</i> may be the petrified stems of <i>Lepidodendron Pedroanum</i>.
    The structure of the central cylinder of Renault’s
    species is of the type represented by <i>L. Harcourtii</i>; the
    xylem forms a continuous ring and does not consist of separate
    strands of tracheae as Renault believed.</p>

  <h5 id="L_australe">10. <i>Lepidodendron australe</i> (M’Coy). <a href="#fig187">Figs. 187</a>, A–C.</h5>

  <p>Specimens described under this name are interesting rather
    on account of their extended geographical range and geological
    antiquity than on botanical grounds. The drawings reproduced
    in <a href="#fig187">fig. 187</a> illustrate the characteristic appearance of this Lower
    Carboniferous and Upper Devonian type, as represented by a
    specimen recently described<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> from the Lower Karroo (Dwyka)
    series, which is probably of Carboniferous age, near Orange
    River Station, South Africa. The surface is divided into polygonal
    or rhomboidal areas (figs. A and B) 8–9 mm. long and
    7–8 mm. broad, arranged in regular series and representing
    leaf-scars, comparable with those of <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i> and other
    species, or possibly partially decorticated leaf-cushions. A short
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>distance below the apex of each area there is a more or less
    circular prominence or depression (<a href="#fig187">fig. 187</a>, B) and on a few of
    the areas there are indications of a groove (fig. A, <i>g</i>) extending
    from the raised scar to the pointed base, as at <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig187">
    <img class="illowp86" src="images/fig187.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 187. <i>Lepidodendron australe.</i> Fig. A, nat. size.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In examining the graphitic layer on the surface of the
    South African specimen shown in <a href="#fig187">fig. 187</a>, A, use was made of
    a method recently described by Professor Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. A few
    drops of collodion were placed on the surface, and after a short
    interval the film was removed and mounted on a slide. The
    addition of a stain facilitated the microscopic examination and
    the drawing of the collodion film. The cell-outlines (<a href="#fig187">fig. 187</a>, C)
    on the surface of the polygonal areas may be those of the
    epidermis, but they were more probably formed by a subepidermal
    tissue; the scar, which interrupts the continuity of
    the flat surface, may mark the position of a leaf-base, or,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>assuming a partial decortication to have occurred prior to
    fossilisation, it may represent a gap in the cortical tissue caused
    by the decay of delicate tissue which surrounded the vascular
    bundle of each leaf in its course through the cortex of the
    stem. If the impression were that of the actual surface of a
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> or a <i>Sigillaria</i>, we should expect to find traces
    of the parichnos appearing on the leaf-scar as two small scars,
    one on each side of the leaf-bundle. In specimens from Vereeniging
    described in 1897<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> as <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i>, which bear a
    superficial resemblance to that shown in fig. A, the parichnos is
    clearly shown. On the other hand, an impression of a partially
    decorticated Lepidodendroid stem need not necessarily show the
    parichnos as a distinct feature: owing to its close association
    with the leaf-trace in the outer cortex, before its separation in
    the form of two diverging arms, it would not appear as a
    distinct gap apart from that representing the leaf-bundle.
    The absence of the parichnos may be regarded as a point in
    favour of the view that the impression is that of a partially
    decorticated stem. Similarly, the absence of any demarcation
    between a leaf-cushion and a true leaf-scar such as characterises
    the stems of Lepidodendra and many Sigillariae is also favourable
    to the same interpretation.</p>

  <p>In 1872 Mr Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> described some fossils from Queensland,
    some of which appear to be identical with that shown in
    <a href="#fig187">fig. 187</a> under the name <i>Lepidodendron nothum</i>, Unger<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, a
    species founded on Upper Devonian specimens from Thuringia.
    The Queensland plant is probably identical with Dawson’s
    Canadian species, <i>Leptophloeum rhombicum</i><a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. In 1874 M’Coy<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
    instituted the name <i>Lepidodendron australe</i> for some Lower
    Carboniferous specimens from Victoria, Australia: these are
    in all probability identical with the Queensland fossils referred
    by Carruthers to Unger’s species, but as the identity of the
    German and Australian plants is very doubtful<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> it is better to
    adopt M’Coy’s specific designation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

  <p>Krasser<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> has described a similar, but probably not specifically
    identical, type from China; from Devonian rocks of Spitzbergen
    Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> has figured, under the name <i>Bergeria</i>, an example of
    this form of stem, and Szajnocha<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> has described other specimens
    from Lower Carboniferous strata in the Argentine.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidodendron australe</i> has been recorded from several
    Australian localities<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> from strata below those containing the
    genus <i>Glossopteris</i> and other members of the Glossopteris, or, as
    it has recently been re-christened, the Gangamopteris<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Flora.</p>

  <h4 id="Fertile_shoots_of_Lepidodendreae">viii. <i>Fertile shoots of</i> Lepidodendron.</h4>

  <h5 id="Lepidostrobus">A. <i>Lepidostrobus.</i></h5>

  <p>The generic name <i>Lepidostrobus</i> was first used by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
    for the cones of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, the type-species of the
    genus being <i>Lepidostrobus ornatus</i>, the designation given by
    the author of the genus to a Lepidostrobus previously figured
    by Parkinson<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> in his <i>Organic Remains of a Former World</i>.
    The generic name <i>Flemingites</i> proposed by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> in 1865,
    under a misapprehension as to the nature of spores which he
    identified as sporangia, was applied to specimens of true <i>Lepidostrobi</i>.
    Brongniart also instituted the generic name <i>Lepidophyllum</i>
    for detached leaves of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, both vegetative
    and fertile; the specimen figured by him in 1822 as <i>Filicites</i>
    (<i>Glossopteris</i>) <i>dubius</i><a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>, and which was afterwards made the type-species
    of the genus, was recognised as being a portion of the
    lanceolate limb of a large single-veined sporophyll belonging to
    a species of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>.</p>

  <p>In an unusually large <i>Lepidophyllum</i>, or detached sporophyll
    of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>, in the Manchester University Museum, the
    free laminar portion reaches a length of 8 cm.</p>

  <p>It is not uncommon to find <i>Lepidodendron</i> preserved in the
    form of a shell of outer cortex, which has become separated
    along the phellogen from the rest of the stem; as the result of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>compression the cylinder of bark may assume the appearance of
    a flattened stem covered with leaf-cushions. A specimen preserved
    in this way was described by E. Weiss as a cone of <i>Lomatophloios
    macrolepidotus</i> Gold., and is quoted by Solms-Laubach and
    other authors<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> as an example of an unusually large <i>Lepidostrobus</i>.
    An examination of the type-specimen in the Bergakademie of
    Berlin convinced me that Weiss had mistaken the partially
    destroyed leaf-cushions for sporophylls, and Stigmarian rootlets,
    which had invaded the empty space, for sporangia<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.</p>

  <p>In external appearance some species of <i>Lepidostrobus</i> bear a
    superficial resemblance to the cone of a Spruce Fir (<i>Picea
    excelsa</i>), but the surface of a lycopodiaceous strobilus is usually
    covered by the overlapping and upturned laminae which
    terminate the more or less horizontal sporangium-bearing
    portion of the sporophyll.</p>

  <p>Fig. 188 affords a good example of a long and narrow
    <i>Lepidostrobus</i>. This specimen from the Middle Coal-Measures
    of Lancashire has a length of 23 cm.; like other <i>Lepidostrobi</i>
    it is borne at the tip of a slender shoot. The fossil is sufficiently
    well preserved to show the characteristic radially
    elongated form of the large sporangia and the long and upturned
    distal portions of the sporophylls.</p>

  <p>We may briefly describe <i>Lepidostrobus</i> as follows:—Cylindrical
    strobili consisting of an axis containing a single cylindrical
    stele which agrees generally with that of the vegetative
    shoots of <i>L. Harcourtii</i> and other species. The amount of
    parenchymatous pith varies in different forms; in some the
    primary xylem is almost solid. The middle cortical region,
    which has usually been destroyed before fossilisation, possesses
    the loose lacunar structure characteristic of this region in the
    vegetative branches. The thicker walled outer cortex is continued
    at the periphery into crowded, usually spirally disposed
    sporophylls, each of which consists of a more or less horizontal
    pedicel, which may be characterised by a keel-like median
    ridge on its lower surface, while to the central region of the
    upper face is attached a large radially elongated sporangium.
    One of the chief differences between a <i>Lepidodendron</i> cone
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>and those of the recent genus <i>Lycopodium</i> is the greater radial
    elongation of the sporangia in the former. Some species of
    <i>Lepidostrobus</i> may have been homosporous; some are known to
    be heterosporous. In the latter the megasporangia borne on
    the lower sporophylls usually contain several megaspores as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
    <i>Isoetes</i> (cf. <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E). Beyond the distal end of the sporangium
    the sporophyll becomes broader in a horizontal plane and is
    bent upwards as a lanceolate limb; it may also be prolonged a
    short distance downwards as a bluntly triangular expansion.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the Palaeozoic <i>Lepidodendra</i>,
    like <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i> (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>) and other recent Lycopods,
    usually bore their cones at the tips of slender shoots. The
    fertile shoot of <i>Lepidophloios scoticus</i> shown in <a href="#fig160">fig. 160</a>, B, affords
    one of several instances supporting this statement; similar
    examples are figured by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, Morris<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>, and by more recent
    writers. The apparently sessile cone figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
    from a specimen in the Manchester Museum is certainly not
    <i>in situ</i>, but is accidentally associated with the stem.</p>

  <p>The general absence of secondary wood in the steles of
    <i>Lepidostrobi</i> is, as Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> points out, consistent with the
    view that the cones were shed on maturity and that fertilisation
    probably took place on the ground, or perhaps on the surface of
    the water where the slender hairs of the megaspores (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>,
    F, I) may have served to catch the microspores.</p>

      <i>Lepidostrobus.</i> Section through the apical region of a cone above the axis.
        (Manchester University Collection.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 189 is an accurate representation of a transverse
    section, 6 mm. in diameter, of what is no doubt the apical
    portion of a <i>Lepidostrobus</i> from the Coal-Measures of Shore,
    Lancashire. The section cuts across the upturned free laminae
    above the level of the apex of the cone-axis. Each lamina
    contains a small vascular bundle composed of a few tracheae and
    some thin-walled cells surrounded by delicate mesophyll tissue.
    Immediately in front of the distal end of a sporangium a
    small ligule is borne on the upper face of the sporophyll
    (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, A, B, <i>l</i>) occupying the same position as in <i>Selaginella</i>
    (cf. <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, F). Strands of vascular tissue pass in a steeply
    ascending course from the xylem to the pedicels of sporophylls,
    finally curving upwards and ending in the upper limb.
    Each vascular bundle consists of a strand of xylem, apparently
    of mesarch structure, accompanied by a few layers of parenchyma
    on its outer face and by a group of cambiform elements,
    the whole being enclosed in a sheath of parenchyma continuous
    with the inner cortex of the cone axis. The vascular bundle is
    accompanied by a parichnos in the outer cortex and in the
    sporophyll.</p>

  <p>Reference has already been made to the belief on the part
    of some palaeobotanists that the large scars of <i>Ulodendron</i>
    represent attachment-surfaces of sessile cones, and reasons have
    been given against the acceptance of this view.</p>

  <p>There is considerable range in the size of <i>Lepidostrobi</i>. An
    incomplete specimen, 33 cm. long and 6 cm. broad, which
    may have been 50 cm. in length, is described by Renault and
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> from the Commentry Coal-field. The larger cones
    afford a striking demonstration of the enormous spore-output
    of some species of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p>Among the earliest accounts of the anatomy of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>
    are those by Hooker<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and Binney<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. One of the specimens
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>described by the former author (<a href="#fig190">fig. 190</a>) affords an interesting
    example of an unusual manner of fossilisation; a hollow stem or
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> is filled with sedimentary material containing
    several pieces of <i>Lepidostrobi</i> in an approximately vertical
    position.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The fact that <i>Lepidostrobi</i> usually occur as isolated specimens
    renders it impossible in most cases to refer them to
    particular species of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. Neither external features
    nor anatomical characters afford satisfactory criteria by which
    to correlate vegetative and fertile shoots; in some measure this
    is due to the imperfection of our knowledge as regards the
    range of structure within the limits of species; it is also due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
    to lack of information as to the extent to which the transition
    from sterile to fertile portions of a shoot is accompanied by
    anatomical differences. Prof. Williamson wrote: “I have for
    many years endeavoured to discover some specific characters by
    which different <i>Lepidostrobi</i> can be distinguished and identified,
    but thus far my efforts have been unsuccessful<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.” In a few
    cases, such as those mentioned in the description of <i>Lepidodendron
    Veltheimianum</i> and <i>L. Wünschianum</i>, it has been possible
    to correlate cones and vegetative shoots.</p>

  <p>The most complete account we possess of the anatomy of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> cones is that by Mr Maslen<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, who first demonstrated
    the occurrence of a ligule on the sporophylls, and thus
    supplied a missing piece of evidence in support of the generally
    accepted view as to the homology of the sporangium-bearing
    members and foliage leaves.</p>

  <p>Under this specific name are included strobili from Upper
    Carboniferous rocks which, in spite of minor differences, may be
    considered as one type. The cylindrical cones vary considerably
    in size, some reaching a length of 50 cm. or more. The sporophylls
    are attached by a pedicel, 4–8 mm. long, at right angles
    to the axis, while the distal portion forms an oval lanceolate
    limb 10–20 mm. in length. The sporangia are 4–8 mm. long.</p>

  <p>Williamson<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> instituted this term for strobili previously
    described by Binney<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>, without adequate evidence, as the cones
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>of <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii</i>. In shape and in the main
    morphological features this type resembles <i>L. variabilis</i>, which
    is however known only in the form of casts and impressions.
    A cone of <i>L. oldhamius</i>, 2–3 cm. in diameter, possesses a
    medullated stele consisting of a ring of primary xylem (fig.
    191, D, <i>x</i>) with exarch protoxylem and no secondary elements.
    Maslen found several short tracheae at the periphery of the
    xylem and states that these led him to compare the cone with the
    vegetative shoots of <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>, but the common
    occurrence of such elements in different types of shoot renders
    them of little or no specific value. The inner cortex is like
    that of vegetative shoots of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and the middle
    cortex, which was no doubt of the type described in <i>Lepidostrobus
    Brownii</i>, is represented by a gap in the sections, beyond
    which is the stronger outer cortex (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, D) passing into the
    horizontal pedicels of the sporophylls. The section of the axis
    reproduced in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, D, was figured by Binney<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> as <i>Lepidodendron
    vasculare</i>. The leaf-traces, several of which are seen
    in the middle cortical region in fig. D, <i>lt</i>, consist of a strand
    of scalariform tracheae, with a mesarch protoxylem, succeeded
    by a few parenchymatous cells; beyond these there is usually
    a small gap which was originally occupied by a strand of thin-walled
    cells. It is important to note that in one sporophyll-trace
    figured by Maslen<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> there is a strand of thin-walled
    elongated elements abutting on the xylem, which he describes
    as phloem. This tissue is certainly more like true phloem than
    any which has hitherto been described in the leaf-traces of
    vegetative shoots. The state of preservation is not, however,
    sufficiently good to enable us to recognise undoubted phloem
    features.</p>

  <p>In such cones as I have examined no tissue has been seen
    which shows the histological features characteristic of the
    secretory zone of vegetative shoots: the “phloem” (Maslen)
    occupies the position in the sporophyll bundle which in the
    vascular bundles of foliage leaves is occupied by a dark-celled
    and partially disorganised tissue in continuity with the secretory
    zone of the main stele. It may be that in the strobili
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>this tissue occurred in a modified form, but even assuming that
    the section figured by Maslen shows true phloem, an assumption
    based on slender evidence, this is not sufficient justification
    for the application of the term phloem to a tissue occupying
    a corresponding position in vegetative shoots and distinguished
    by well-marked histological features.</p>

  <p>The sporophyll-traces, as seen in the outer cortex in fig.
    191, D, are partially surrounded by a large crescentic space, <i>p</i>,
    which was originally occupied by the parichnos. The sporangia
    are attached along the middle line of the sporophyll and, as in
    <i>Lepidostrobus Brownii</i>, a cushion of parenchyma projects into
    the lower part of the sporangial cavity (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, A, <i>a</i>; C, <i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The diagrammatic sketch of part of a section in the Binney
    Collection reproduced in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, B, shows the position of the
    ligule, <i>l</i>. No megaspores have been discovered in any specimens
    of this type; the microspores, which occur both singly
    and in tetrads, have a length of 0·02–0·03 mm.</p>

  <p>The drawing shown in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, A, based on a section in the
    Binney Collection, illustrates the general arrangement of the
    parts of a typical <i>Lepidostrobus</i>. I have made use of this
    sketch instead of that given by Maslen, as his figure conveys
    the idea that the sporophylls are superposed, whereas, whether
    they are verticillate or spiral, a radial longitudinal section
    would not cut successive sporangia in the same plane.</p>

  <h5 id="L_Brownii">iii. <i>Lepidostrobus Brownii</i> (Brongn.).</h5>

  <p>In 1843 a specimen of a portion of a petrified cone was
    purchased by the British Museum, assisted by the Marquis of
    Northampton and Robert Brown, for £30 from a French
    dealer. This fossil, from an unknown locality, was briefly
    described by Brown in 1851<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> and named by him <i>Triplosporites</i>,
    but in a note added to his paper he expressed the opinion that
    the generic designation <i>Lepidostrobus</i> would be more appropriate.
    Brongniart afterwards named the cone <i>Triplosporites</i>
    <i>Brownii</i><a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, and Schimper<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> described it in his <i>Traité</i> as <i>Lepidostrobus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
    Brownii</i>. The type-specimen is preserved in the British
    Museum and the Paris Museum possesses a piece of the same
    fossil.</p>

  <p>The central axis of the cone has a stele of the type
    characteristic of <i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i> and <i>L. Harcourtii</i>,
    and the xylem is surrounded by a thin-walled tissue described
    by Bower<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> as possibly phloem; but in the absence of longitudinal
    sections it is impossible to say how far the tissue
    external to the xylem agrees with that in Lepidodendron stems.
    The sporophylls consist of a horizontal portion, to the upper
    face of which the radially elongated sporangia are attached, one
    to each sporophyll; beyond the distal end of the sporangium
    the sporophyll bends sharply upwards as a fairly stout lamina.
    The wall of the sporangium is composed of several layers of
    cells, as shown in a drawing published by Bower<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>; in the
    interior occur groups of microspores, and from a ridge of tissue
    which extends along the whole length of the sporangium
    irregular trabeculae of sterile tissue project into the sporangial
    cavity, as in <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, H: cf. <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, H).</p>

  <p>Further information in regard to <i>Lepidostrobus Brownii</i> has
    recently been supplied by Prof. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>, who recognises the
    existence of a ligule, and draws attention to some interesting
    histological features in the tissue of the sporophylls<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>.</p>

  <h6><i>Spores of Palaeozoic Lycopodiales.</i></h6>

  <p>The calcareous nodules from the Coal seams of Yorkshire
    and Lancashire are rich in isolated spores, many of which are
    undoubtedly those of <i>Lepidostrobi</i>. Examples of spores were
    figured by Morris<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> in 1840, and their occurrence in coal has
    been described by several authors, one of the earliest accounts
    being by Balfour<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>. The drawings of Palaeozoic and recent
    spores published by Kidston and Bennie<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> demonstrate a striking
    similarity between the megaspores of existing and extinct
    Lycopods, the chief difference being the larger size of the fossils.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

  <p>The general generic name <i>Triletes</i>, originally used by
    Reinsch<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>, is a convenient term by which to designate Pteridophytic
    spores which cannot be referred to definite types.</p>

  <p>It is usual to find more than four megaspores in each megasporangium
    in Palaeozoic and not infrequently, as we have seen,
    in Mesozoic lycopodiaceous strobili, but in some Palaeozoic cones,
    e.g. <i>Bothrostrobus</i> (<a href="#fig216">fig. 216</a>) and <i>Lepidostrobus foliaceus</i><a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>, a single
    tetrad only appears to have reached maturity.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of long simple or branched and sometimes
    capitate hairs is a common feature of Carboniferous megaspores
    (<a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, E, F, I). It is possible that these appendages served
    to catch the microspores, thus facilitating fertilisation. A
    peculiar form of megaspore has been described by Mrs Scott<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>,
    and assigned by her to <i>Lepidostrobus foliaceus</i>, the megasporangium
    of which apparently contained only four spores. As
    shown in <a href="#fig191">fig. 191</a>, G, a large bladder-like appendage characterised
    by radiating veins is attached to the thick spore-coat; it is
    suggested that this excrescence may be compared with the
    “swimming” apparatus of the recent water-fern <i>Azolla</i>. The
    epithet swimming which it is customary to apply to the
    appendages of <i>Azolla</i> megaspores would seem to be inappropriate
    if Campbell<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> is correct in stating that spores of <i>Azolla</i>
    are incapable of floating.</p>

  <p>Another type of lycopodiaceous strobilus, differing sufficiently
    from <i>Lepidostrobus</i> to deserve a special generic designation,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>is that originally described by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>, from the Lower
    Coal-Measures of Yorkshire, as a type of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>, <i>L. insignis</i>,
    but afterwards<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> more fully investigated and assigned to
    a new genus by Scott<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>. It should be pointed out that in a
    later publication Williamson spoke of the lycopodiaceous axis,
    which he suspected might belong to his <i>L. insignis</i>, as possibly
    worthy of recognition as a distinct generic type.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig192">

      <i>Spencerites insignis</i> (Williamson). (After Miss Berridge.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the two species included by Scott in his genus <i>Spencerites</i>
    only one, <i>S. insignis</i>, need be considered. Since the publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
    of Scott’s paper our knowledge of this type has been
    extended by Miss Berridge<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and by Prof. Lang<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.</p>

  <p>The axis of the strobilus has a stele characterised by a
    pith of elongated elements, most of which have thin walls;
    the xylem cylinder possesses about twenty protoxylem strands
    forming more or less prominent exarch ridges. The cortex
    exhibits a differentiation comparable with that in the shoots of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The sporophylls are arranged in alternating
    verticils, each whorl consisting of ten members: the narrow
    horizontal pedicel of a sporophyll, containing a single vascular
    bundle, as shown in <a href="#fig192">fig. 192</a>, is expanded distally into a
    prominent upper lobe bearing a cushion of small and delicate
    cells, to which the sporangium is attached, and prolonged obliquely
    upwards as a free leaf-like lamina. The lower blunt prolongation
    of the sporophylls appears to form a thick dorsal lobe, but,
    as Lang has pointed out, it is highly probable that the present
    form of the dorsal lobe is of secondary origin, and is “due to the
    disappearance of a mucilage cavity from a large sporophyll
    base<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.” As Miss Berridge remarks, the vascular bundle of the
    sporophyll does not give off a branch to the ventral lobe and
    sporangium. In attachment, in shape, and in the structure of
    the wall the sporangia differ markedly from those of <i>Lepidostrobi</i>.
    The spores, which also constitute a characteristic feature of
    the genus, have a maximum diameter of 0·14 mm.; they are
    described as oblate spheroids with a broad hollow wing running
    round the equator (<a href="#fig192">fig. 192</a>) comparable with the air-sacs of the
    pollen of <i>Pinus</i>. Scott points out that the spores of <i>Spencerites</i>
    are intermediate in size between the microspores of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and the megaspores of <i>Lycopodium</i>; it is difficult therefore
    to decide to which category they should be referred. <i>Spencerites</i>
    is clearly distinct from <i>Lepidostrobus</i>; the absence of a ligule,
    the manner of attachment of the sporangia, and the form and
    size of the spores, are characteristic features.</p>

  <p>A comparison of <i>Spencerites</i> with the strobili of <i>Lycopodium
    cernuum</i> (figs. <a href="#fig123">123</a>, <a href="#fig126">126–129</a>) has recently been made by Lang,
    who draws attention to the striking agreement as regards general
    plan and even detailed structural features between the Palaeozoic
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>and the recent type of strobilus. It is interesting to find, as
    Lang points out, that in the original account of the fossil cone
    by Williamson, the view is expressed that the sporangiophores
    were confluent. An examination of the section figured by
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> led Lang to confirm this opinion. It would be
    out of place to enter here into a detailed comparison of
    <i>Spencerites insignis</i> and the cone of <i>Lycopodium</i>, but the resemblances
    are considered by Lang to be sufficiently close to suggest
    that the striking similarity may be indicative of relationship<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of notice that the radial section of <i>Spencerites</i>
    (<a href="#fig192">fig. 192</a>) presents a fairly close resemblance to a corresponding
    section through a cone-scale of <i>Agathis</i> (Kauri Pine)<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. In each
    case the megasporangium is attached by a narrow pedicel to
    the sporophyll and the latter has a similar form in the two
    plants, though the extent of the resemblance is somewhat
    lessened by Lang’s more complete account of the Palaeozoic
    type. If the <i>Spencerites</i> sporangia possessed an integument
    the similarity with the <i>Agathis</i> ovule would of course be much
    closer: recent palaeobotanical investigations have shown that
    ovules and sporangia are not separated by impassable barriers.</p>

  <p>[Since this Chapter was set up in type a paper has appeared
    by Dr Bruno Kubart on a new species of <i>Spencerites</i> spore,
    <i>S. membranaceus</i>, from the Ostrau-Karwiner Coal-basin (Austria).
    The spores are larger than those of <i>S. insignis</i> and in some the
    cells of a prothallus are preserved. Kubart figures a section of
    a spore containing a group of seven cells, a central cell, which
    he regards as an antheridial mother-cell, surrounded by six wall-cells.

  <h4>i. <i>General.</i></h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> view of the close resemblance between <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and <i>Sigillaria</i>, another lycopodiaceous plant characteristic of
    Carboniferous and Permian floras, a comparatively brief description
    of the latter genus must suffice, more particularly as
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> has received rather an undue share of attention.
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, though abundantly represented among the relics of
    Palaeozoic floras, especially those preserved in the Coal-Measures,
    is rare in a petrified state, and our knowledge of its
    anatomy is far from complete. In external form as in internal
    structure the difference between the two genera are not such as
    enable us to draw in all cases a clearly defined line of separation.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Antediluvian Phytology</i>, Artis<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> figured a fossil from
    the Carboniferous sandstones of Yorkshire which he called
    <i>Euphorbites vulgaris</i> on account of a superficial resemblance
    to the stems of existing succulent Euphorbias. Rhode<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> also
    compared Sigillarian stems with those of recent <i>Cacti</i>. The
    specimen described by Artis is characterised by regular vertical
    and slightly convex ribs bearing rows of leaf-scars in spiral series,
    like those on the cushions of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. A few years earlier
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> had instituted the genus <i>Sigillaria</i><a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> for plants with
    ribbed but not jointed stems bearing “disc-like impressions” (leaf-scars)
    disposed in quincunx; the type-species named by the author
    of the genus <i>Sigillaria scutellata</i> is identical, as Kidston<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> points
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>out, with <i>Euphorbites vulgaris</i> of Artis and with the plant afterwards
    figured by Brongniart as <i>S. pachyderma</i><a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. Brongniart in
    1822 figured another type of stem characterised by the absence
    of ribs and by prominent spirally arranged cushions bearing
    relatively large leaf-scars like the upper part of the specimen
    shown in <a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>; this he named <i>Clathraria Brardii</i>, a well-known
    and widely distributed Carboniferous and Permian species
    now spoken of as <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i> (figs. <a href="#fig196">196</a>, A–C; <a href="#fig203">203</a>). A
    third type of stem figured by Brongniart as <i>Syringodendron
    striatum</i><a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> agrees with <i>Sigillaria scutellata</i> in having ribs, but
    differs in the substitution of narrow oval ridges or depressions
    for leaf-scars; this is now recognised as a partially decorticated
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, in which the vascular bundle of each leaf is represented
    by a narrow ridge or depression. The name <i>Syringodendron</i>,
    originally used by Sternberg, is conveniently applied
    to certain forms of Sigillarian stems which have lost their
    superficial tissues. A fourth generic name, <i>Favularia</i>, was
    instituted by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> for Sigillarian stems with ribs covered
    with contiguous leaf-scars of hexagonal form and prominent
    lateral angles (<a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, A; <a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, G).</p>

  <p>The generic or sub-generic title <i>Rhytidolepis</i>, also instituted
    by Sternberg, is applied to ribbed Sigillarian stems such as
    <i>S. scutellata</i>, <i>S. rugosa</i> (<a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, B), <i>S. mammillaris</i> (<a href="#fig195">fig. 195</a>), or
    <i>S. laevigata</i> (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, D). Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> proposed the name
    <i>Leiodermaria</i> for smooth Sigillarian stems with leaf-scars not
    in contact with one another (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, C).</p>

  <p>The shoot system of <i>Sigillaria</i> consisted of a stout stem
    tapering upwards to a height of 100 feet<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> or more as an unbranched
    column, with its dome-shaped apex<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> covered with
    linear grass-like leaves or, in some species, such as <i>Sigillaria
    Brardi</i><a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>, <i>S. Eugenii</i><a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>, etc., the main trunk was occasionally divided
    by apparently equal dichotomy. The younger portions of the
    stem or branches were in some species clothed with leaves
    separated by a narrow zigzag groove surrounding their hexagonal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
    bases, while in other forms each leaf was seated on a
    more or less prominent cushion having the form illustrated by
    <i>Sigillaria McMurtriei</i> (<a href="#fig194">fig. 194</a>) or by the example represented in
    <a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, H; or as in the ribbed species shown in figs. <a href="#fig193">193</a>, B, and
    <a href="#fig195">195</a>, the leaves in vertical series were separated from one another
    by longer portions of the ribs. As in <i>Lepidodendron</i> the cushions
    are frequently characterised by irregular transverse wrinklings
    and other<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> surface-ornamentation which in some instances at
    least may have been produced as the result of <i>post-mortem</i>
    shrinkage of superficial tissue. From the rarity of shoots with
    the foliage attached, it would seem that the leaves persisted for
    a comparatively short time and were cut off by an absciss-layer
    leaving behind a well-marked leaf-scar area. The linear leaves,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>reaching in rare cases a length of one metre (e.g. <i>S. lepidodendrifolia</i>)
    but usually much shorter, possessed a single median
    bundle, and the lower face was characterised by two stomatal
    grooves and a median keel. It is not uncommon to find leaf-bases
    of <i>Sigillaria</i> detached from the stem and preserved as
    separate impressions. The term <i>Sigillariophyllum</i> used by
    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> may be applied to detached leaves, though it is
    by no means easy to distinguish between the foliage of <i>Sigillaria</i>
    and <i>Lepidodendron</i>. A comparison of a typical species of
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, such as <i>S. rugosa</i> (<a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, B) or <i>S. Brardi</i>
    (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, A–C) with a typical <i>Lepidodendron</i> reveals obvious
    differences in the form of the leaf-cushion, but in some cases
    the distinction becomes purely arbitrary.</p>

  <p>Immediately above the centre of the upper boundary of a
    Sigillarian leaf-scar a ligule pit may often be detected, as
    shown in <a href="#fig195">fig. 195</a>, <i>l</i>, and in some cases, e.g. a specimen figured
    by Germar<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, A) as <i>Sigillaria spinulosa</i> (identical with
    <i>S. Brardi</i>), some circular scars with a central pit surrounded by
    a raised rim occur on the surface of the stem, either singly
    or in pairs, near the leaf-scars; these, it is suggested, may
    represent the position of adventitious roots or, as Germar
    thought, of some deciduous spinous processes. The leaf-scars
    are frequently hexagonal in shape, with the lateral angles
    either rounded (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, F) or sharply pointed (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, G, H);
    each scar bears three smaller scars as in <i>Lepidodendron</i>, a
    central circular, oval or crescentic leaf-trace scar and larger
    oval or slightly curved scars formed by the two parichnos arms
    (<a href="#fig195">fig. 195</a>, <i>p</i>). The larger size of the parichnos arms, the individual
    cells of which may often be detected as a fine punctation,
    is a distinguishing feature of the genus, but otherwise the
    structure is very similar to that in <i>Lepidodendron</i>. As shown
    in figs. <a href="#fig195">195</a>, <a href="#fig200">200</a>, F, G, the three scars may occur nearer the
    upper than the lower margin of the leaf-base area.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidodendron Wortheni</i><a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, E), described from North
    America by Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>, by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> from France, and by
    Kidston<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> from the Upper and Middle Coal-Measures of England,
    may be quoted as a <i>Lepidodendron</i> bearing a close resemblance
    to <i>Sigillaria</i>. The shoots bear cushions two or three times as
    long as broad and without the usual median division, but with
    numerous irregular and discontinuous transverse wrinklings.
    <i>Lepidodendron Peachii</i> Kidston<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> affords another example of a
    form agreeing both with <i>Sigillaria</i> and with <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    An Upper Devonian type described by White<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> as <i>Archaeosigillaria
      primaeva</i> affords a striking instance of the combination
    on one stem of Sigillarian and Lepidodendroid leaf-cushions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

  <p>The difference between the original surface of a Sigillaria
    stem and that of partially decorticated specimens is seen in
    <a href="#fig122">figs. 196</a>, C and D; in fig. C the bark of <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i>
    shows the characteristic wrinklings of the superficial tissue,
    while at a slightly lower level the leaf-scars are replaced by
    the parichnos casts, a, and fine longitudinal striations represent
    the elongated phelloderm cells laid bare by the exfoliation of
    the surface-layers. Similarly, in the rib of <i>Sigillaria laevigata</i>
    (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, D) the parichnos arms, <i>p</i>, and the longitudinal striations
    are exposed at the lower level, while the surface is smooth
    and bears rows of widely separated leaf-scars.</p>

  <p>The older part of a Sigillarian stem may present an appearance
    very different from that of the younger shoots. The
    leaf-cushions may be stretched apart as the result of elongation
    and increase in girth, while in some cases the arrangement of the
    leaf-scars may vary on the same axis as the result of inequalities
    in growth or changing climatic conditions. The contiguous
    arrangement of the leaf-scars and narrow cushions characteristic
    of the Clathrarian form of stem, as was first demonstrated by
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>, and afterwards illustrated by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and Kidston, may
    be gradually replaced (on the same specimen) by a more distant
    disposition of the leaf-scars separated by a smooth intervening
    surface of bark. The specimen of <i>S. Brardi</i> reproduced in part
    in <a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>, and first figured by Kidston, affords an example
    of three “species” on one piece of stem, <i>S. Brardi</i> Brongn.,
    <i>S. denudata</i> Goepp. and <i>S. rhomboidea</i> Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

  <p>The piece of <i>Carica</i> stem, represented in <a href="#fig197">fig. 197</a>, illustrates
    the danger of trusting to the disposition of leaves as a specific
    criterion.</p>

  <p>Similarly, in the ribbed forms the degree of separation of
    the leaf-scars is by no means uniform in a single species<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>.
    Some authors have adopted a two-fold classification of Sigillarian
    stems proposed by the late Prof. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> of Berlin, who
    divided the Sigillariae into (A) Sub-Sigillariae, comprising
    Leiodermariae and Cancellatae, and (B) Eu-Sigillariae, including
    <i>Favulariae</i> and <i>Rhytidolepis</i>. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> adopts the
    terms <i>Rhytidolepis</i> and <i>Leiodermaria</i> for ribbed and smooth
    stems respectively, the type to which the name <i>Clathraria</i> was
    applied by Brongniart being in some cases at least the young
    form of Leiodermarian stems. While recognising the artificial
    distinction implied by such terms as <i>Rhytidolepis</i>, <i>Leiodermaria</i>,
    and other sub-generic titles, we may conveniently speak of the
    two main types of <i>Sigillaria</i> stems as ribbed and smooth.</p>

  <p>Still older stems of <i>Sigillaria</i> are not uncommon from which
    the leaf-scars and other superficial tissues have been exfoliated,
    leaving exposed a longitudinally fissured surface of secondary
    cortex characterised by pairs of considerably enlarged parichnos
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>strands (<a href="#fig198">fig. 198</a>) which are sometimes partially or wholly
    fused into one (<i>Syringodendron</i> state of <i>Sigillaria</i>). The single
    or double nature of the elliptical or circular parichnos areas is
    doubtless due to the degree of exfoliation, which may extend
    sufficiently deep into the cortex to reach the level of the
    parichnos before the single strand has bifurcated (cf. <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
    p. 100). In the Museums of Manchester, Newcastle,
    and other places casts of large Sigillaria stems may be seen,
    which illustrate the differences in breadth and regularity of the
    vertical ribs, and in the size and shape of the parichnos areas
    in different regions of a partially decorticated stem. A cast of a
    ribbed species in the Manchester Museum, having a length of
    185 cm. and a breadth of 56 cm., shows in the upper portion
    straight vertical grooves and broad ribs bearing pairs of parichnos
    scars 11 mm. long; in the lower portion the ribs tend to
    become obliterated and the parichnos scars, 2 cm. in length,
    may be partially fused and arranged in much less regular vertical
    series. A feature of these older ribbed Sigillarian stems is the
    increase in the number of the ribs from below upwards. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
    has described a specimen in the Sunderland Museum, 6 feet
    6 inches long, with a circumference at the slightly bottle-shaped
    base of 5 feet. On the lower portion of the stem there are
    29 broad ribs; about one-third the height many of these
    bifurcate, producing as many as 40 ribs in the upper part
    where the cast has a circumference of 3 feet. The increase
    in number of the ribs is due in part to bifurcation, but also
    to the intercalation of new ones. As Kidston points out, this
    example shows that as a stem grew in length additional leaves
    were developed at the apex. A similar stem, which illustrates
    very clearly the increase in the number of ribs from below
    upwards, may be seen in the Newcastle Museum.</p>

  <p>Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> has described an example of an old stem of a
    ribless species of <i>Sigillaria</i>, <i>Syringodendron bioculatum</i>, bearing
    single and double parichnos areas of nearly circular form and
    with a diameter of 1–2 cm. In a specimen figured by Renault
    and Roche<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> (<i>Syringodendron esnostense</i>) from the Culm strata
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>in France, the parichnos scars reach a length of 3 cm. As seen
    in the fragment of a ribbed <i>Sigillaria</i> represented in <a href="#fig198">fig. 198</a>,
    the large parichnos areas exhibit a distinct surface pitting in
    contrast to the fine longitudinal striation of the rib; the
    difference in surface-appearance is due to the nature of the
    tissue, which in the parichnos consists of fairly large parenchymatous
    elements with groups of secretory cells<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>, and in the
    exposed cortex of elongated elements. The vertical line in the
    middle of <a href="#fig198">fig. 198</a>, which occurs in the middle of the rib, has
    probably been formed by splitting of the bark.</p>

  <p>Grand’Eury’s description of fossil forests of Sigillariae in
    the rocks of the St Étienne<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> district affords a striking picture of
    these arborescent Pteridophytes; he speaks of the stems of some
    of the trees as swollen like a bottle at the base, characterised
    by the Syringodendron features and terminating below in
    short repeatedly forked roots of the type known as <i>Stigmariopsis</i>.
    Other specimens of <i>Sigillaria</i> stumps show a marked
    decrease in girth towards the base; this tapered form is
    regarded by Grand’Eury as the result of the development of
    aerial columnar stems from underground rhizomes.</p>

  <p>The nature of the root-like organs of <i>Sigillaria</i> is dealt
    with in the sequel: a brief reference may, however, be made
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>to the occurrence of stumps of vertical trunks which pass downwards
    into regularly forked and spreading arms. These arms
    lie almost horizontally in the sand or mud like the underground
    rhizomes of <i>Phragmites</i> and other recent plants growing in
    swampy situations where water is abundant and where deeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
    penetration of the soil would expose them to an insufficient
    supply of oxygen<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>. It is certain that <i>Sigillaria</i> had no tap-root,
    but was supported on spreading subterranean organs bearing
    spirally disposed long and slender rootlets which absorbed water
    from a swampy soil.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The regularity of the leaf-scar series on a Sigillarian stem
    may be interrupted by the occurrence of oval scars with a
    central scar and surrounding groove (<a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, E); these occur
    in zones at more or less regular intervals on the stem, as seen
    in the partially decorticated cast represented in <a href="#fig199">fig. 199</a>.
    Zeiller has pointed out that the rows of oval or circular scars,
    which mark the position of caducous stalked strobili, may occur
    between the leaf-scars in vertical series, each of which may
    include as many as 20 scars, while in other cases a single series
    of such cone-scars may encircle the stem<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. The zones are
    usually of uneven breadth, as in <i>S. Brardi</i>, and their occurrence
    produces some deformation of the adjacent leaf-scars.</p>

  <p>By the earlier writers <i>Sigillaria</i> was compared with succulent
    Euphorbias, Cacti, and Palms; Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> at first
    included undoubted Sigillarian stems among Ferns, but after
    investigating an agatized stem from Autun, he referred <i>Sigillaria</i>
    to the Gymnosperms<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> on the ground that it had the
    power of producing secondary wood. It was then supposed
    that <i>Lepidodendron</i> possessed only primary xylem, and that
    the presence of a vascular meristem in <i>Sigillaria</i> necessitated
    its separation from the lycopodiaceous genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and its inclusion in the higher plants. By slow degrees it was
    recognised, as in the parallel case of the genus <i>Calamites</i>, that
    the presence or absence of secondary vascular tissue is a
    character of small importance. Williamson, whose anatomical
    researches played the most important part in ridding the minds
    of palaeobotanists of the superstition that secondary growth in
    thickness is a monopoly of the Phanerogams, spoke in 1883 of
    the conflict as to the affinities of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i> as
    virtually over but leaving here and there “the ground-swell of a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>stormy past<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.” In 1872 the same author had written: “If then
    I am correct in thus bringing the Lepidodendra and Sigillariae
    into such close affinity, there is an end of M. Brongniart’s theory,
    that the latter were gymnospermous exogens, because the cryptogamic
    character of the former is disputed by no one; we must
    rather conclude as I have done that the entire series represents,
    along with the Calamites, an exogenous group of Cryptogams in
    which the woody zone separated a medullary from a cortical
    portion<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.”</p>

  <p>In 1879 Renault<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> expressed the opinion that Brongniart by
    his investigation of the anatomy of <i>Sigillaria elegans</i> had
    established in a manner “presque irréfutable” that <i>Sigillaria</i>
    must be classed as a Gymnosperm showing affinity with the
    Cycads.</p>

  <p>In 1855 Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> described some strobili which he regarded
    as those of <i>Sigillaria</i> and recognised their close
    resemblance to a fertile plant of <i>Isoetes</i>. He was led to the
    conclusion, which had little influence on contemporary opinion,
    that <i>Sigillaria</i> is related to <i>Isoetes</i> and must be classed among
    Pteridophytes. To these long and narrow strobili Schimper
    gave the name <i>Sigillariostrobus</i><a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. In 1884 Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> supplied confirmation
    of Goldenberg’s view by the discovery of cones borne
    on pedicels with Sigillarian leaf-scars, thus demonstrating the
    generic identity of cones and vegetative shoots, which Goldenberg
    had connected on the evidence of association. Zeiller’s
    more recent work<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and the still later researches of Kidston<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
    have added considerably to our knowledge of the morphology
    of Sigillarian cones. Grand’Eury’s remark made so recently as
    1890<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> that opinion in regard to the Gymnospermous nature of
    <i>Sigillaria</i> is losing ground every day, bears striking testimony
    to the pertinacity with which old beliefs linger even in the face
    of overwhelming proof of their falsity.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable, in view of the abundance of vegetative
    shoots, how rarely undoubted Sigillarian strobili have been
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>found; this may, however, be in part due to a confusion with
    Lepidostrobi which so far as we know do not differ in important
    respects from Sigillariostrobi<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that <i>Sigillaria</i> usually produced its
    cones on slender pedicels which bore a few leaves or bracts in
    irregular verticils, or in short vertical series on comparatively
    stout stems, an arrangement reminding us of the occurrence of
    flowers on old stems of <i>Theobroma</i> and other recent Dicotyledons.
    As Renault<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> pointed out the fertile shoots are axillary in origin.</p>

  <p>Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> is of opinion that certain species of <i>Sigillaria</i>
    bore cones sessile on large vegetative shoots characterised by
    two opposite rows of cup-like depressions like those in the
    Ulodendron form of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i> (<a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a>).
    He has described the Ulodendron condition of two species,
    <i>Sigillaria discophora</i> (König) and <i>S. Taylori</i> (Carr.); the cup-like
    depressions may have a diameter of several centimetres
    and are distinguished from those of <i>Bothrodendron</i> by the
    almost central position of the umbilicus. The specimens
    which he figures as <i>S. discophora</i> are identified by him with
    the stem figured by König as <i>Lepidodendron discophorum</i> and
    by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> as <i>Ulodendron minus</i>. We have
    already dealt with the nature of Ulodendron shoots, expressing
    the opinion that in spite of the often quoted specimen described
    by D’Arcy Thompson<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>, in which a supposed cone occurs in one of
    the cups, there is no satisfactory case of any undoubted cone
    having been found attached to the large Ulodendron scars. It
    is more probable that the Ulodendron depressions represent
    the scars of branches, either elongated axes, or possibly in
    some cases deciduous tuberous shoots which served as organs
    of vegetative reproduction. A specimen figured by Kidston
    as <i>Sigillaria Taylori</i> from the Calciferous sandstone of Scotland<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
    bears a row of slightly projecting “appendicular organs”
    attached to a Ulodendron axis; but these furnish no proof of
    their strobiloid nature. The main question is, are these Ulodendron
    shoots correctly identified by Kidston as Sigillarian?
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>The surface of the specimens shows crowded rhomboidal scars
    surrounded in some cases by a very narrow border or
    cushion; the general appearance is, as Kidston maintains, like
    that of <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i> in which the leaf-scars are contiguous
    (e.g. <a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>, upper part). None of the leaf-scars exhibit
    the three characteristic features, the leaf-trace and parichnos
    scars, but only one small scar appears on each leaf-base area.
    In a more recent paper Kidston figures a small piece of a
    stem from Kilmarnock, which he identifies as <i>Sigillaria discophora</i>,
    showing the three characteristic scars on the leaf-base
    area. There is no doubt as to the Sigillarian nature of this
    specimen, but it is not clear if the piece figured is part of a
    Ulodendron shoot<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.</p>

  <p>Prof. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> retains the older name <i>Ulodendron minus</i> Lind.
    and Hutt. in place of König’s specific designation and dissents
    from Kidston’s identification of <i>Ulodendron minus</i> and <i>U. majus</i>
    of Lindley and Hutton as one species; he is also inclined to
    refer these Ulodendron axes to <i>Lepidodendron</i>. In spite of the
    superficial resemblance to <i>Sigillaria</i> of the specimens described
    by Kidston, and which I have had an opportunity of examining,
    I venture to regard their reference to that genus as by no
    means definitely established. We must recognise the difficulty
    in certain cases of drawing any satisfactory distinction between
    <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i> based on external features, and
    while giving due weight to the conclusions of so experienced a
    palaeobotanist as my friend Dr Kidston, I venture to think we
    are not in a position to state with confidence that <i>Sigillaria</i>
    possessed Ulodendron shoots.</p>

  <h4 id="Leaves">ii. <i>Leaves.</i></h4>

  <p>The leaves of <i>Sigillaria</i> agree closely with those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>;
    they are either acicular (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, D) like Pine
    needles or broader and flatter like the leaves of <i>Podocarpus</i>.
    Their attachment to comparatively thick branches<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>shows that they persisted, in some cases at least, for several
    years as in <i>Araucaria imbricata</i>. The lower surface of the
    lamina was characterised by a prominent keel (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, A
    and C) which dies out towards the apex; on either side of it
    are well-defined stomatal grooves (figs. <a href="#fig142">142</a>, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>; <a href="#fig143">143</a>, A; <a href="#fig200">200</a>,
    D, <i>g</i>). The upper face may be characterised by another groove
    (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B) but without stomata. The occurrence of the
    stomatal grooves, the abundance of transfusion tracheae
    (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, <i>t</i>) surrounding the vascular bundle, and the presence
    of strengthening hypodermal tissue suggest that the
    leaves of <i>Sigillaria</i> were of a more or less pronounced xerophilous
    type and had a fairly strong and leathery lamina. The
    mesophyll tissue consists either of short parenchymatous cells
    or of radially elongated palisade-like elements and has the loose
    or lacunar arrangement characteristic of the aerating system
    in recent leaves; the slight development or absence of palisade-tissue
    may indicate exposure to diffuse light of no great intensity.</p>

  <p>In most species there is a single vein, but in others the xylem
    forms a double strand (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B). Sections of the lamina near
    the apical region present a more circular form, owing to the
    gradual obliteration of the upper groove and lower keel and to
    the dying out of the stomatal grooves.</p>

  <p>The transverse section of the leaf diagrammatically represented
    in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, A, A′, shows the two stomatal grooves, <i>g</i>,
    and a prominent keel; the single vein consists of a small group
    of primary tracheae, <i>x</i>, some delicate parenchyma, and a brown
    patch of imperfectly preserved tissues, <i>a</i>, resembling the secretory
    zone tissue of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The whole is surrounded
    by a sheath of rather wide and short thinner-walled spiral or
    reticulate tracheids, which may be spoken of as transfusion
    tracheae, <i>t</i>, and compared with similar elements in the leaves
    of many recent Conifers. To this tissue Renault applies the
    epithet “water-bearing” and it is very likely that this may have
    been its function. The shaded portions of the lamina, in
    <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, A, represent the distribution of thicker-walled hypodermal
    tissue. The section of a leaf 3 mm. wide shown in
    <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, C, shows an almost identical structure; the transfusion
    tracheae are richly developed especially on the sides and lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
    surface of the vascular strand. This leaf occurs in association
    with a petrified stem of <i>Sigillaria scutellata</i><a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.</p>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> has shown that the leaf-traces of <i>Sigillaria
    spinulosa</i> (= <i>S. Brardi</i>) are accompanied in the outer cortical
    region of the stem by a fairly large amount of secondary xylem;
    in sections of the free lamina which he figures the secondary
    elements are much less obvious and represented by a few
    tracheae only. Similarly, in the leaf-base of <i>S. Brardi</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>(<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, E) the xylem consists of both primary and secondary
    elements (<i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>), but in the lamina the latter is poorly if at all
    represented. In the lamina of the leaves of <i>S. Brardi</i> the
    primary xylem forms a narrow slightly curved band with two
    lateral groups of narrower, presumably protoxylem elements;
    this is surrounded by delicate parenchyma styled by Renault, on
    very slender evidence, phloem (“liber”). Some dark cells below
    the xylem are described as sclerous tissue, and surrounding the
    bundle is a sheath of transfusion tracheae (dotted area in
    <a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, E). It is possible that the elements spoken of with
    hesitation by Renault as secondary xylem are transfusion
    tracheae.</p>

  <p>There has probably been some confusion in the minds of
    authors between sclerous tissue and dark secretory tissue in
    Sigillarian leaves; the crescentic band, <i>a</i>, shown in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B,
    which corresponds in position with the sclerous tissue of
    Renault in <i>S. Brardi</i> leaves, appears to be of the nature of
    secretory tissue.</p>

  <p>The diagram shown in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B, illustrates a type of leaf
    very like those already described, except that there are two
    xylem strands, <i>x</i>. The difference between the double strand and
    the single bundle seen in figs. <a href="#fig142">142</a>, A, C and <a href="#fig200">200</a> E, is comparatively
    small, but it is a real distinction. This type of leaf
    (<a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B) was originally described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> under the
    generic title <i>Sigillariopsis</i>. The genus was founded on a French
    petrified specimen consisting of part of a ribbed stem possessing
    a stele of the Sigillarian type and characterised by separate
    primary xylem strands, like those of <i>S. Brardi</i> described by
    Brongniart in 1839. Renault considered the presence of two
    xylem strands in the leaf a sufficient reason for the institution
    of a new genus and named the specimen <i>Sigillariopsis Decaisnei</i>.
    Prof. Bertrand of Lille kindly photographed for me Renault’s
    type-specimen and sent several prints with explanatory notes.
    The transverse section of the leaves shows very clearly the two
    xylem strands; each strand consists of a triangular group of
    primary tracheae with the protoxylem apex pointing towards
    the lower surface of the lamina. Below each primary strand
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>of centripetal xylem is an arc composed of a few small tracheae
    which Renault and Bertrand describe as secondary xylem; it
    is, however, not clear from the photomicrographs that these
    are of secondary origin, their position and appearance reminding
    one of the primary centrifugal xylem of a cycadean foliar
    bundle. Below this centrifugal xylem is another arc of imperfectly
    preserved elements described by Renault as a
    protective sheath and by Bertrand as glandular tissue; the
    latter term is probably the more correct as the tissue may well
    correspond to the secretory-zone tissue of Lepidodendron stems.
    Fairly large groups of transfusion tracheids occur on the flanks
    of the xylem. Prof. Bertrand points out that one of his sections,
    cut nearer the apex of a leaf than that figured by Renault with
    a single xylem strand, contains a double strand and thus shows
    the latter’s description to be an incorrect interpretation of the
    imperfectly preserved tissues.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sigillariopsis</i> type of leaf was recognised by Scott<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
    in English material on which he founded the species <i>Sigillariopsis
    sulcata</i>. In a section which he has recently figured<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> a
    lacuna below the two xylem strands is described as “representing
    secretory tissue”; a band of transfusion tracheae almost encircles
    the pair of bundles.</p>

  <p>In a note published in 1907, Kidston<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> demonstrated the
    association of <i>Sigillariopsis</i> leaves with an undoubted Sigillarian
    stem of the Rhytidolepis type and expressed his
    conviction that Renault’s genus is identical with <i>Sigillaria</i>.
    The correctness of Kidston’s conclusion has been proved by
    Arber and Thomas<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> who found that the leaf-traces of <i>Sigillaria
    scutellata</i> bifurcate during their course through the outer region
    of the cortex and enter the leaf as two distinct strands of
    primary xylem. In the section from Dr Kidston’s collection
    shown in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, B, the lamina, 4 mm. wide, consists mainly of
    thin-walled assimilating tissue composed of radially elongated
    cells abutting at the periphery on hypodermal mechanical tissue,
    except at the edges of the stomatal grooves which are bounded
    by the small-celled epidermis. A broad sheath of thicker-walled
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>elements, <i>s</i>, surrounds numerous scattered transfusion tracheae, <i>t</i>,
    and below the two xylem strands, <i>x</i>, which are embedded in
    delicate parenchyma there is a crescentic band of dark tissue, <i>a</i>,
    resembling the smaller strand, <i>a</i>, in <a href="#fig142">fig. 142</a>, A′, and the secretory
    zone tissue of a Lepidodendron stem.</p>

  <h4 id="Fertile_shoots">iii. <i>Fertile shoots of</i> Sigillaria.</h4>

  <p>Reference has already been made to the manner of occurrence
    of strobili on Sigillarian stems; it remains to describe the
    structure of these reproductive shoots. <i>Sigillariostrobus</i>, the
    name given to Sigillarian strobili, may be defined in general
    terms as follows:</p>

  <p>Cylindrical cones, rarely dichotomously branched<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> as in
    species of <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>, which may reach a
    length of 30 cm. (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Sigillariostrobus nobilis</i> Zeill.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>) and a
    diameter 2–5 cm.; peduncle long and slender, sometimes
    bearing acicular bracts or, after leaf-fall, characterised by leaf-cushions
    and leaf-scars like those on vegetative shoots
    (<a href="#fig201">fig. 201</a>, E). The stalked cones are borne in irregular verticils
    and in some species in vertical series, the fertile zones being
    separated by comparatively long sterile portions of the stem
    (<a href="#fig199">fig. 199</a>). The cones were deciduous and, in certain cases if
    not in all, the individual sporophylls became detached from
    the cone-axis on maturity. The slender axis bore spiral or
    verticillate imbricate sporophylls attached at right angles or
    more or less obliquely. The basal rhomboidal portion bore
    spores on its upper surface (<a href="#fig201">fig. 201</a>, F), presumably enclosed
    in a somewhat radially elongated sporangium (fig. B) and was
    prolonged distally into a narrow lanceolate free portion, in some
    species with a ciliate border (fig. D). The sporangia probably
    produced megaspores and microspores, but such spores as have
    been recognised appear to belong to the former category. The
    designation <i>Triletes</i> is applied to isolated spores of <i>Sigillaria</i> or
    to those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sigillariostrobus Tieghemi</i> Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> (<a href="#fig201">figs. 201</a>, E, F). In this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>species, from the Coal-field of Valenciennes, the pedicel bore
    acicular leaves or bracts attached to the upper portion of leaf-cushions
    arranged in vertical series (fig. E). The cones reached
    a length of 16 cm. and a breadth of 2·5–5 cm.; the sporophylls
    are borne in alternating verticils with 8–10 in each whorl.
    Several megaspores (2 mm. in diameter) appear to have been
    produced in tetrads in each sporangium.</p>

  <h6><i>Sigillariostrobus rhombibracteatus</i> Kidston<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. Fig. 201, A, C.</h6>

  <p>Kidston described this species from the Middle Coal-Measures
    of England: it is similar in habit and in the form of
    the sporophylls to <i>S. Tieghemi</i>, but rather smaller, and the more
    definitely rhomboidal sporophylls have a ciliate margin. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>cone was probably heterosporous, but megaspores alone have so
    far been discovered. The sporophylls bear a close resemblance
    to those of <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i> (<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, C). In some of the
    illustrations of this type given by Kidston the naked cone-axis
    with its numerous sporophyll-scars is clearly shown, reminding
    one of the naked axes of the cones of the Silver Fir (<i>Abies
    pectinata</i>) or Cedar after the fall of the scales.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of Sigillarian cones is too incomplete to
    admit of a detailed comparison with the strobili of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    or with those of recent Pteridophytes. There can, however, be
    little doubt that Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> was correct in his selection of
    <i>Isoetes</i> as the most nearly allied recent plant so far as the fertile
    leaves are concerned. It would seem that the sporangia were
    comparatively delicate structures which have left no clearly
    defined remains of their walls in the carbonised specimens;
    Kidston, indeed, speaks of the hollow bases of the sporophylls as
    holding the spores, but this is hardly likely to have been the
    case. Our knowledge of the anatomy of <i>Sigillariostrobus</i> is
    practically nil, but in one specimen of a <i>Sigillaria elegans</i>
    stem Kidston<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> describes the structure of the tissues as seen in
    a transverse section of a scar of a fertile shoot; from this we
    learn that the stele was composed exclusively of primary
    tracheids forming a solid strand without a pith. It is probable
    that the cones of <i>Sigillaria</i> were heterosporous, but in no
    instance have undoubted microspores been discovered; the
    megaspores in each megasporangium were fairly numerous as in
    <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E). In one species, <i>Sigillariostrobus major</i>
    (Germar), from Permian rocks of France and Germany, Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
    states that the whole of a single cone bore megaspores (0·8–1
    mm. in diameter) only; this is, however, not opposed to the idea
    of heterospory, as we find instances in <i>Selaginella</i> of strobili
    bearing one kind of spore only (cf. p. 56).</p>

  <p>In a few instances, it has been possible to correlate cones
    with certain species of <i>Sigillaria</i>, but in most cases the strobili
    occur as isolated fossils.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

  <h4 id="Sigillarian_stems">iv. <i>The structure of Sigillarian stems.</i></h4>

  <p>The first account of the anatomy of <i>Sigillaria</i> we owe to
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> who published a description of the internal structure
    of an agatised stem, about 4 cm. in diameter, from Autun, which
    he referred to <i>Sigillaria elegans</i>. It has, however, been shown
    by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> and by Renault that this petrified fragment belongs
    to Brongniart’s species <i>S. Menardi</i>, which is probably a young
    form of <i>S. Brardi</i>. Brongniart’s specimen, now preserved in
    the Paris Natural History Museum, is a very beautiful example
    of a silicified plant: on part of the surface are preserved the
    hexagonal contiguous leaf-scars, like those shown in <a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, A,
    and on the polished transverse section is seen a relatively large
    stele consisting of a ring of secondary xylem surrounding
    a series of crescentic groups of primary xylem (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, A)
    enclosing a wide pith occupied by concentric layers of silica. A
    portion of the outer cortex is preserved, and this is separated
    from the stele by a broad space filled with siliceous rock. The
    main features of this type may be described in a few words.
    The primary xylem differs from that of such Lepidodendron
    stems as have been described in being made up of groups of
    scalariform and occasionally reticulate (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, C) tracheae,
    having a plano-convex or more or less crescentic form as seen in
    transverse section. These primary strands, in contact with one
    another laterally, have their narrowest elements on the outer
    edge. The leaf-traces are given off from the middle of the
    abaxial face of each xylem strand (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, C, <i>lt</i>); these pass
    obliquely outwards through medullary rays and then, as in
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, turn sharply upwards before bending outwards
    again on their way to the leaves. Each leaf-trace consists of a
    group of primary tracheae to which a few secondary tracheae are
    added during the passage through the secondary wood. The
    secondary xylem forms a continuous cylinder of tracheae with
    scalariform bands on both radial and tangential walls; the
    medullary rays are numerous and consist of long and narrow
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>series, usually one cell broad, of parenchymatous cells with
    occasional short rays one or more cells in depth.</p>

  <p>The slightly greater breadth of the rays between each
    primary xylem strand tends to divide the secondary wood
    into bundles corresponding in breadth to the primary groups.
    The outer cortex closely resembles that of <i>Lepidodendron</i>;
    it consists internally of radial series of secondary, elongated
    and rather stout, elements abutting on the parenchymatous
    tissue of the leaf-cushions.</p>

  <p>The next contribution to our knowledge of the anatomy of
    <i>Sigillaria</i> was made by Renault and Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> who described
    the structure of <i>Sigillaria spinulosa</i> Germar<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, a species now
    recognised as the Leiodermarian condition of <i>S. Brardi</i>, and
    probably, therefore, not specially distinct from the specimen
    described by Brongniart in 1839 as <i>S. elegans</i>. In Brongniart’s
    fossil the leaf-cushions are in contact (Clathrarian form of <i>S.
    Brardi</i>: <a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>, upper part) whereas in the specimen now
    under consideration the leaf-scars are further apart (Leiodermarian
    form of <i>S. Brardi</i>, <a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>, lower part, and <a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, C).
    It may be, as Scott suggests, that these two specimens are not
    specifically identical but closely allied, an opinion based on
    certain anatomical differences<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>; we may, however, include both
    under the comprehensive name <i>S. Brardi</i>.</p>

  <p>The primary xylem (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, B, <i>x</i>), is in some regions
    separated into distinct strands, in others it forms a continuous
    band equal in length to several of the separate groups. This
    type of stele, in which the primary xylem consists in part of
    separate strands and in part of a continuous cylinder, forms a
    transition between that represented in <a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, A, and the steles
    of <i>Sigillaria elegans</i> (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, A) and most species of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
    The tendency of the primary xylem strands to become
    united laterally, forming broader bands, was first described by
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> in a French specimen of <i>Sigillaria spinulosa</i> in
    the Williamson collection. The leaf-traces arise from the middle
    of the concave outer face of the primary xylem groups. The inner
    cortex is composed of small parenchymatous cells as in <i>Lepidodendron</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
    and it is noteworthy that traces of partially
    disorganised tissue, described as large canals, in the region
    external to the secondary wood, bear a resemblance<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> to the
    secretory tissue of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p>Other interesting features are presented by the structure of
    the outer cortex and the parichnos. The outer cortex in the
    leaf-scar region is composed of parenchyma, but for the most
    part it consists of radially elongated groups of thin-walled
    parenchyma enclosed in a framework of thicker-walled and
    elongated elements (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, B, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>). This type of cortex, to
    which Brongniart applied the name <i>Dictyoxylon</i>, would produce
    a cast in the case of a partially decorticated stem characterised
    by a surface formed of irregularly oval and raised areas bounded
    by narrow grooves; the greater prominence of the former being
    due to the more rapid decay of the softer tissue, which would
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>produce depressions on the exposed face of the dead stem.
    Casts of this type are not uncommon in Carboniferous rocks,
    and while some may belong to the Pteridosperm <i>Lyginodendron</i>,
    others may be those of Sigillarian stems.</p>

  <p>The large parichnos-strands, produced as in <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
    by the forking of a single strand arising in the middle cortical
    region, consist in part of tissue containing secretory canals, a
    structure like that recently described by Miss Coward<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> in the
    large parichnos strands of <i>Syringodendron</i> stems.</p>

  <p>An example of a decorticated specimen is described by
    Renault<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> as <i>Sigillaria xylina</i>. This stem is presumably referred
    to <i>Sigillaria</i> because the primary xylem consists of separate
    strands. It is characterised by the unusually large development
    of secondary wood and by the relatively small size of the
    pith. The xylem cylinder has a diameter of 4–5 cm. and the
    pith is only 4–5 mm. in breadth.</p>

  <p>Another example of a petrified Sigillaria stem has been
    described by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> as <i>S. elegans</i> Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> (<a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, D), a
    species characterised by vertical rows of sub-hexagonal and
    contiguous leaf-scars and by the presence of verticils of cone-scars.
    Fig. 193, D, represents Kidston’s specimen in surface-view;
    one row of leaf-scars is shown, but most of the superficial
    tissues have been destroyed. The crushed stele, 13 mm. in its
    longest diameter, has a continuous cylinder of primary xylem,
    (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, A, <i>x</i>) characterised by a regularly crenulate outer
    margin with the smallest elements at the edge; the prominent
    ridges separating the sinuses are rounded. The leaf-traces arise
    from the bottom of each sinus; the leaf-bundles are mesarch, and
    consist exclusively of primary elements. The secondary xylem,
    <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>, like that of the primary xylem, has a crenulate outer edge.
    The most interesting feature of the outer cortex is afforded by
    a tangential section which, in addition to the leaf-scars, cuts
    through a cone-scar showing a solid primary stele surrounded
    by the cortex of the cone-peduncle.</p>

  <p>Another type of <i>Sigillaria</i>, probably <i>S. elongata</i> Brongn.
    (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, B, C), which is very similar to <i>S. scutellata</i> has been
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>briefly described by Prof. Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>, to whom my thanks are
    due for the two photographs reproduced in <a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, B., C. His
    specimen, from the Pas de Calais Coal-field, shows a ribbed
    Rhytidolepis form of surface (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, B). The stele (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, C)
    agrees closely with that of <i>S. elegans</i> as described by Kidston,
    but the ridges on the fluted surface of the primary xylem are
    more pointed. “In the immediate neighbourhood of the origin
    of a leaf-trace, the spiral elements form a median band in the
    middle of a sinus” and from this the leaf-traces are given off.
    No secondary xylem was found in the leaf-traces at any part of
    their course.</p>

  <p>Bertrand compares the stele of <i>S. elongata</i> with that of the
    type of <i>Lepidodendron</i> represented by the Burntisland species
    named by Williamson <i>L. brevifolium</i> (<a href="#fig186">fig. 186</a>) and now usually
    referred to <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>; the chief distinguishing features
    are the greater prominence in the French species of the surface-ridges
    or teeth of the primary xylem, a feature which occurs in
    <i>L. Wünschianum</i>, and the detachment of the leaf-traces from
    the bottom of each sinus (<a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>, C, <i>lt</i>) instead of from the
    sides of the sinus. It is, however, not clear how far this latter
    distinction is a real one; in <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i> the
    leaf-traces appear to arise, as in <i>Sigillaria</i>, from the middle of
    each sinus.</p>

  <p>Other types of ribbed Sigillaria stems have been briefly
    described by Scott<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>, Kidston<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>, and more recently, by Arber
    and Thomas<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>.</p>

  <p>The specimen described by Scott agrees in the main with
    <i>S. elegans</i> of Kidston and with <i>S. elongata</i> of Bertrand.</p>

  <p>Kidston’s sections of <i>S. scutellata</i> show a continuous primary
    xylem cylinder with a slightly and irregularly crenulate outer
    margin. It would seem that one important diagnostic character
    in Sigillarian stems is afforded by the degree and form of the
    crenulations on the outer surface of the primary xylem. <i>S. scutellata</i>
    has been described also by Arber and Thomas; these
    authors were the first to demonstrate the presence of a ligule
    and ligular pit on the leaf-base in a petrified stem, and they
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>also contribute the important fact that the leaf-traces in passing
    through the phelloderm bifurcate and enter the leaf as two
    distinct vascular strands. This double bundle has been referred
    to in the description of Sigillaria leaves. (<a href="#Page_214">page 214</a>.)</p>

  <p>Although our knowledge of the anatomy of <i>Sigillaria</i>
    has been considerably extended since Williamson<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> drew attention
    to our comparative ignorance of the subject, there are
    several points on which information is either lacking or very
    meagre. As regards the stele, it is in all types so far investigated,
    of the medullated type and constructed on the
    same plan as that of <i>Lepidodendron Wünschianum</i>, <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>,
    and other species. Secondary xylem was developed
    at an early stage of growth, and its relation to the primary
    xylem, from which as Kidston points out in his description of
    <i>S. elegans</i>, it may be separated by a few parenchymatous elements,
    is like that in <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The tendency of the
    outer face of the secondary xylem to present a crenulate
    appearance in transverse sections may, as Scott thinks<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>, be a
    feature of some diagnostic importance, but this is not a constant
    character in the genus. In origin and in their mesarch structure,
    the leaf-traces closely resemble those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The
    earlier account of the structure of the leaf-traces of <i>Sigillaria</i>,
    which were described as possessing both centrifugal and centripetal
    wood, led Mettenius<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> to draw attention to an important
    anatomical resemblance between this genus and modern Cycads.
    This comparison was, however, based on a misconception; the
    Cycadean leaf-trace, consisting solely of primary wood, is not
    strictly comparable with those of some species of <i>Sigillaria</i>, in
    which one part of the xylem is primary and another secondary.
    The occasional presence of secondary xylem in Sigillarian leaf-traces
    is matched in some <i>Lepidodendra</i><a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>, and cannot be
    accepted as a distinguishing feature.</p>

  <p>The origin of the leaf-traces from the middle of the sinuses
    on the edge of the primary xylem is regarded as a difference; in
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> the leaf-traces are said to arise in some species
    from the sides of the crenulations; but, as already pointed out,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>this is a distinction of doubtful value. The division of the
    primary xylem into separate strands in some stems of <i>Sigillaria</i>
    of the Clathrarian and Leiodermarian forms is a characteristic
    peculiarity; but <i>S. spinulosa</i> forms a connecting link between
    this type and the continuous arrangement of the xylem in <i>S. elongata</i>
    and <i>S. elegans</i>. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> has shown that the discontinuous
    primary xylem occurs in Lower Permian species, a fact consistent
    with the view that the greater abundance of the
    centripetally developed wood, characteristic of the older species,
    represents a more primitive feature. This is not merely a
    conclusion drawn from a consideration of geological age, but it
    is in harmony with the view expressed by Scott<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> that as plants
    achieved greater success in producing secondary centrifugal
    wood, the retention of any considerable quantity of primary
    xylem became superfluous. As yet we know very little of
    the structure of the perixylic tissues of <i>Sigillaria</i>, but there
    is no sufficient reason for supposing that these differ in
    essentials from those in <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The middle and outer
    cortical tissues are practically identical in the two genera. The
    parichnos is of the same type, except that in <i>Sigillaria</i> it
    reached greater dimensions in the outer part of its course.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The aerial shoots of this species are occasionally branched
    dichotomously<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>, the apical portions bearing short crowded leaves<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>;
    the surface of the bark is either completely covered with contiguous
    leaf-scars without definite leaf-cushions or with projecting
    cushions forming a narrow sloping surface surrounding each
    leaf-scar. Other parts of the plant may possess cushions similar
    in their kite-shaped form to those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, but without
    a median vertical groove, or the leaf-scars may be spirally disposed
    at varying distances apart on a comparatively smooth and longitudinally
    wrinkled bark. The species exhibits striking instances
    of a transition between the Favularian, Clathrarian, and Leiodermarian
    forms of stems. The leaf-scars, which are hexagonal in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>outline,—the lateral angles pointed and transversely elongated,
    the upper and lower angles rounded,—bear three scars, the
    central leaf-trace and two straight or curved lateral parichnos
    scars; a ligular pit occurs immediately above the centre of the
    upper edge of the leaf-scar and occasionally circular elevations
    with a central pit occur singly or in pairs below a leaf-scar
    (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, A). The linear leaves, which may persist on shoots
    having a fairly large diameter<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>, have a single median vein and
    two stomatal grooves on the lower surface<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, D).</p>

  <p>Partially decorticated and younger shoots are characterised
    by the occurrence of pairs of elliptical parichnos areas and a
    smaller median leaf-trace scar. The surface of older stems,
    which may show signs of longitudinal splitting (<i>Syringodendron</i>
    state), bears pairs of parichnos scars reaching a length of
    2–2·5 cm. and a breadth of 10–13 mm. The regularity of the
    leaf-scar arrangement is interrupted at intervals by the occurrence
    of more or less regular verticils of scars marking the
    position of deciduous shoots. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> has figured cones
    which he believes to be those of this species, and Zeiller refers
    the large strobili, <i>Sigillariostrobus major</i>, to <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i><a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

  <p>The subterranean axes were characterised by spirally disposed
    rootlet-scars like those of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> (figs. <a href="#fig204">204</a>, <a href="#fig205">205</a>) and
    by a cortical surface with the features of <i>Stigmaria rimosa</i> Gold.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

  <p>The anatomy of the stele and leaves has already been
    described (<a href="#Page_219">p. 219</a>). The stele of the Stigmarian portion of the
    plant consists of a band of centripetal primary xylem and a
    cylinder of centrifugally formed secondary wood with medullary
    rays containing vascular bundles passing out to the rootlets<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Sigillaria Brardi</i> occurs not uncommonly in Permian rocks;
    it is recorded from France<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>, Germany<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>, Pennsylvania<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>, and
    elsewhere. It is found in the Upper, Middle, and Lower
    Coal-Measures of England<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and in Permo-Carboniferous strata
    in Africa<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> and Brazil<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>.</p>

  <h3>Stigmaria.</h3>

  <p><i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> is the name given to cylindrical casts met
    with in Palaeozoic rocks, from the Devonian<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> to the Permian<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>,
    characterised by a smooth or irregularly wrinkled surface bearing
    spirally disposed circular scars bounded by a raised rim and
    containing a small central pit. It is not uncommon to find
    evidence of a partial collapse of the substance of the plant as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>seen in <a href="#fig204">fig. 204</a>; this is doubtless the expression of a shrinkage
    of the middle cortical region, which was composed of a delicate
    and lacunar system of cells. There can be no reasonable doubt
    that Stigmaria grew in water or in swampy ground. Specimens
    are occasionally met with in which the cast terminates in a
    bluntly rounded apex; such are, perhaps, young branches which
    have not grown far from the base of the aerial stem from which
    they arose (cf. <a href="#fig207">fig. 207</a>, B, C). Other examples occur, such as
    Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> figured and Gresley<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> has more recently described,
    which are twisted and distorted as though obstacles had been
    encountered in the ground in which they grew.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The circular scars mark the bases of long single and
    occasionally forked appendages (rootlets) which spread on all
    sides into the surrounding medium (figs. <a href="#fig205">205</a>, <a href="#fig208">208</a>). The
    occurrence of rootlets radiating through the shale or sandstone
    affords proof that the Stigmarias are often preserved in their
    position of growth. This was recognised by Steinhauer<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> and
    Logan<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>, and has been more recently emphasised by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>an argument in favour of the view that the beds containing
    such specimens are old surface-soils.</p>

  <p><i>Stigmaria</i> usually shows regular dichotomous branching, the
    arms spreading horizontally or slightly downwards and always
    arising from four main branches in the form of a cross (<a href="#fig207">fig. 207</a>).
    The most remarkable specimens found in England are described
    by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> in his monograph of <i>Stigmaria</i>. One of two
    large casts found near Bradford in Yorkshire, and now in the
    Manchester Museum, shows four large primary arms radiating
    from the base of an erect stump 4 feet in diameter. Each
    arm divides a short distance from its base into two, and the
    smaller branches extend almost horizontally for several feet<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.</p>

  <p>An illustration published by Martin in 1809<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> shows a
    characteristic feature of Stigmarian casts, namely the presence
    of a smaller axis, usually occupying an eccentric position
    inside the larger. This represents the cast of the fairly broad
    parenchymatous pith which, on decay, left a space subsequently
    filled by sand or mud: at a later stage the surrounding wood
    and cortex were removed and the cavity so formed was
    similarly filled. A thin layer of coal formed by the carbonisation
    of some of the tissues frequently surrounds the medullary
    cast, and Steinhauer, whose account of the genus is much
    fuller and more scientific than those of other earlier and
    many later writers, recognised the true nature of this internal
    cast. Artis<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> regarded it as the remains of a young plant, which
    he described as “perforating its parent,” at length bursting it
    and assuming its place, a gratuitously drastic interpretation.</p>

  <p>In 1838<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Lindley and Hutton figured a partially petrified
    specimen of <i>Stigmaria</i> obtained by Prestwich from Carboniferous
    rock of Shropshire. This example showed a fairly
    broad cylinder of secondary wood penetrated by medullary
    rays. The medullated stele consisted of a pith surrounded by
    a small amount of primary xylem and by a cylinder of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>secondary scalariform tracheae. The preservation of the tissues
    abutting on the edge of the wood is usually very imperfect, and
    the middle cortex of lacunar parenchyma has practically in every
    case eluded the action of mineralising agents; the outer cortex,
    on the other hand, consists of more resistant elements and is
    frequently well preserved. As in <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>
    stems, meristematic activity produced a broad band of secondary
    cortex; and beyond this were attached to cushion-like pads the
    numerous appendages, each supplied with a single vascular
    bundle which arose from the primary xylem and passed outwards
    through a medullary ray. There is abundant evidence
    that the appendages were hollow, a fact in striking accord with
    the aquatic and semi-aquatic habitat (cf. <i>Isoetes</i> root, <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, G).</p>

  <p>The piece of dried rhizome of <i>Cyperus papyrus</i> shown in fig.
    206 is an almost exact counterpart of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>; the
    wrinkled and shrivelled surface and the circular root-scars
    containing the remains of a vascular bundle are striking
    features in common and, it may be added, the two plants, though
    very different in structure and in systematic position, illustrate
    anatomical adaptations to a similar environment.</p>

  <p>The first figure of <i>Stigmaria</i> is said to be by Petver in 1704;
    Volkmann published illustrations of this common fossil in 1720
    and Parkinson in 1804<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>. Binney, whose researches may be
    said to have inaugurated a new era in the investigation of fossil
    plants, wrote in 1844: “Probably no fossil plant has excited
    more discussion among botanists than the <i>Stigmaria</i>. It is the
    most common of the whole number of plants found in the Coal-Measures,
    but there has hitherto been the greatest uncertainty
    as to its real nature<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>.” This uncertainty still exists, at least in
    the minds of some who know enough of the available data to
    realise that our knowledge is imperfect.</p>

  <p>To pass to the questions of the affinity and nature of
    <i>Stigmaria</i>: Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> at first compared his genus with recent
    Aroideae, but he afterwards<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> spoke of it as probably the root of
    <i>Sigillaria</i>. Other writers regarded <i>Stigmaria</i> as a dicotyledonous
    plant comparable with Cacti and succulent Euphorbias. For
    many years opinion was divided as to whether <i>Stigmaria</i>
    represents an independent and complete plant or the underground
    system of <i>Sigillaria</i>.</p>

  <p>Artis<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>, Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>, as well as Goldenberg<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>, believed
    it to be a prostrate plant unconnected with any erect aerial stem.
    Goldenberg figured one of the slender rootlets terminating in
    an oval body described as a reproductive organ. This seed-like
    impression is either some extraneous body or an abnormal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>development at the end of a rootlet. In 1842 Logan drew
    attention to the almost complete monopolisation by <i>Stigmaria</i>
    of the underclays, the rock which as a general rule occurs below
    a seam of coal. He wrote: “The grand distinguishing feature
    of the underclays is the peculiar character of the vegetable
    organic remains; they are always of one kind (<i>Stigmaria
    ficoides</i>) and are so diffused throughout every part of the bed,
    that by their uniform effect alone the clay is readily recognised
    by the eye of the miner<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>.” This fact, which has played a very
    conspicuous part in the perennial discussions on the origin of
    coal, led to the almost general recognition of the underclays as
    surface-soils of the Coal period forests.</p>

  <p>The next step was the discovery of <i>Stigmaria</i> in the Coal-Measures
    of Lancashire and in the Carboniferous rocks of Cape
    Breton, Nova Scotia, forming the basal branches of erect stems
    identified by Binney<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>, Bowman<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> and Richard Brown<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> as undoubted
    Sigillariae. In one case Brown found what he
    considered to be convincing evidence of the continuity between
    <i>Stigmaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1842 Hawkshaw<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> described certain fossil trees, the largest
    of which had a circumference at the base of 15 ft., discovered, in
    the course of excavations for a railway in Lancashire, in soft shale
    at right angles to the bedding. The surface features were not
    sufficiently clear to enable him to decide with certainty between
    <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i>, but while inclining to the former,
    it is interesting to note that the occurrence of numerous Lepidostrobi
    near the root led him to recognise the possibility of a
    connexion between the Stigmarian roots and Lepidodendron
    stems. In 1846 Binney gave an account of similar trees found
    at Dukinfield near Manchester: he spoke of one stem as unquestionably
    a <i>Sigillaria</i> with vertical ribs, furrows, and scars,
    about 15 inches high and 4 ft. 10 inches in circumference. He
    expressed his conviction that “<i>Sigillaria</i> was a plant of an
    aquatic nature<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>.” Similar descriptions of rooted stems in the
    Coal-Measures of Nova Scotia were published by Brown in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>1845, 1846 and 1849; in the last paper he figured a specimen,
    which has become famous, showing a Syringodendron stem
    terminating in branching Stigmarian (or possibly Stigmariopsis)
    roots bearing on the lower surface a series of what he called
    conical tap roots<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. A similar specimen discovered in Central
    France nearly fifty years later demonstrated the accuracy of
    Brown’s description.</p>

  <p>Despite these discoveries the root-like nature of <i>Stigmaria</i>
    was not universally accepted. It was, however, generally agreed
    that <i>Stigmaria</i> formed the roots of <i>Sigillaria</i>; it was, moreover,
    held by some that <i>Lepidodendron</i> stems also possessed this
    type of root, an opinion based on Brown’s record and on the
    occurrence of <i>Stigmaria</i> in beds containing <i>Lepidodendron</i> but
    no <i>Sigillaria</i> stems, as in the volcanic beds of Arran and elsewhere,
    and on observations of Geinitz and others<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>. There is
    now general agreement that <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i> had
    the same type of “root,” though the connexion of <i>Stigmaria</i>
    with the former was not so readily admitted, and indeed the
    evidence in support of it is still very meagre. Goeppert and
    other authors were unable to believe that the numerous species
    of <i>Sigillaria</i> possessed roots of so uniform a type, but Goeppert,
    by his recognition of several varieties of <i>Stigmaria</i>, supplied
    a partial answer to this objection.</p>

  <p>Messrs Mellor and Leslie<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> have described and figured some
    large casts of roots exposed in Permo-Carboniferous rocks in
    the bed of the Vaal river at Vereeniging (Transvaal) which
    exhibit certain features suggesting comparison with <i>Stigmaria</i>.
    Some of these reach a length of 40–50 feet and, when
    complete, were probably not less than 100 feet long: in some
    of them the centre of the cast from which forked arms spread
    almost horizontally shows a depression in the form of a cross
    indicating a regular dichotomous branching like that of <i>Stigmaria</i>.
    The authors incline to the belief that the roots belong
    to <i>Noeggerathiopsis</i> and not to a lycopodiaceous plant, though
    Lepidodendroid stems are abundant in the sandstone a few feet
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>higher in the series. Despite the absence of any Stigmarian
    scars on the surface of the fossil it is probable that these fine
    specimens are the rhizomes of some lycopodiaceous plant,
    possibly <i>Bothrodendron</i>, which is not uncommon in the Vereeniging
    beds.</p>

  <p>Admitting that <i>Stigmaria</i> is part of <i>Sigillaria</i>, the next
    question is, is <i>Stigmaria</i> a root in the ordinary sense, the underground
    system formed on germination of the spore and of equal
    age with the shoot, or did it bear a different relation to the Sigillarian
    stems? To this question different answers would still be
    given. Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> discussed evidence in favour of the view that
    aerial Sigillarian shoots were produced as vegetative buds
    on pre-existing Stigmarian axes, like young moss plants on
    a protonema. At a later date Renault<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> developed a similar
    view as regards <i>Sigillaria</i>; but we may pass on to consider the
    more recent and complete observations of Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> and
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.</p>

  <p>The recognition of two distinct types of Stigmariae in the
    Coal-Measures of Central France led Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> to institute
    a new genus, <i>Stigmariopsis</i>. This type, which is characterised
    by a difference in habit as well as by other distinguishing
    features, is represented by such specimens as those figured by
    Goldenberg as <i>Stigmaria abbreviata</i>, bearing lenticular scars
    spirally disposed on a cortical surface characterised by irregular
    longitudinal wrinklings. <i>Stigmariopsis</i> has frequently been found
    in direct continuity with Sigillarian stems of the Leiodermarian-Clathrarian
    type, spreading obliquely downwards in the form of
    rapidly narrowing arms clothed with slender and usually simple
    appendages; and from the under surface of these arms short
    conical outgrowths are given off. It is probable, as Solms-Laubach
    believes, that <i>Stigmariopsis</i> was represented also by
    long horizontally creeping rhizomes<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> of uniform breadth from
    which ribless Sigillarian aerial shoots arose as bud-like outgrowths.
    Grand’Eury, the author of the genus, confined the
    term to the shorter and more rapidly tapered organs spreading
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>from the base of erect stems; the horizontal rhizomes of all
    Sigillarian stems he refers to <i>Stigmaria</i>. The pith-casts of
    <i>Sigillariopsis</i> may be recognised by their long vertical ridges
    and grooves, a feature readily understood by reference to the
    stem structure. The <i>Stigmariopsis</i> rhizomes though rare in
    England have been recognised by Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> in the Middle
    Coal-Measures of Yorkshire; he has figured a pith-cast very
    like that illustrated in Solms-Laubach’s Memoir as <i>Stigmariopsis
    anglica</i>.</p>

  <p>The surface-features of a <i>Stigmariopsis</i> pith-cast are clearly
    shown on a specimen from St Étienne in the Williamson
    collection<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">STIGMARIOPSIS</div>

  <p>The most complete account of Grand’Eury’s views in regard
    to the anchoring and absorbing organs of <i>Sigillaria</i> is given in
    his monograph on the Coal-field of Gard<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>, St Étienne, and these
    are clearly stated also by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> who confirms the
    conclusions of the French author as to the manner of development
    of the aerial shoots. Grand’Eury believes that both
    <i>Stigmaria</i> and <i>Stigmariopsis</i> are rhizomes and not true roots.
    The surface-features of <i>Stigmaria</i> have already been described.
    This type Grand’Eury speaks of as characterised by the uniform
    diameter and considerable horizontal elongation of the bifurcated
    axes; he thinks they grew both as floating rhizomes and
    on the ground: they may frequently be traced for a considerable
    distance without showing any signs of connexion with
    aerial shoots, but occasionally they have been seen in organic
    union with Sigillarian stems. He believes that these rhizomes
    were produced as the result of germination under water of the
    spores of <i>Sigillaria</i> or <i>Lepidodendron</i> and developed as long and
    branched aquatic rhizomes capable of independent existence.
    Under certain conditions, as he thinks in shallower water, the
    rhizomes produced bulb-like outgrowths which grew into erect
    stems having the surface-features of <i>Sigillaria</i>. This method
    of origin is practically the same as that described by Goeppert
    in 1865. The vascular medullated cylinder of these erect
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>branches was in direct continuity with that of the Stigmarian
    rhizomes.</p>

        <i>Stigmariopsis</i>. (After Grand’Eury.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The next stage is that in which the undifferentiated bulb
    becomes swollen at the base and develops four primary roots
    (<a href="#fig207">fig. 207</a> B, C) which grow obliquely downwards and produce
    numerous rootlets. Meanwhile the parent rhizome gradually
    decays, finally setting free the aerial stems which are now
    provided with spreading and forked roots (<a href="#fig208">fig. 208</a>) such as we
    are familiar with in English specimens as <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>,
    but which in the French specimens show the features of <i>Stigmariopsis</i>.
    At this later stage conical outgrowths are formed
    from the under surface of the Stigmariopsis arranged in a
    more or less regular series surrounding the centre of the forked
    and spreading roots (<a href="#fig209">fig. 209</a>). These conical and positively
    geotropic organs were long ago described by Richard Brown as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
    tap-roots. Grand’Eury’s conclusions are briefly as follows:
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, and we may add <i>Lepidodendron</i>, had no true roots
    and in this respect are comparable with <i>Psilotum</i> (<a href="#fig118">fig. 118</a>):
    the organs which are described by Grand’Eury as roots are
    correctly so named in a physiological sense, but morphologically
    they do not strictly conform, either in origin or in the arrangement
    of their appendages, to true roots. The question as to
    whether they are entitled to the designation root is one which
    it is needless and indeed futile to discuss in detail; it would be
    conceding too much to a formal academic standpoint to refrain
    from applying to them the term root, as that best describes
    their share in the life of the Sigillarian stems. The horizontal
    Stigmarian axes are rhizomes in the ordinary sense of the term
    and from these were developed Sigillarian shoots, characterised
    in the lower portions by large parichnos strands. From
    the base of the young bulbous shoots roots were formed: these
    roots being, in the French specimens, of the <i>Stigmariopsis</i> type.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig209">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 209.
      <i>Stigmariopsis</i> and “tap-roots.” (After Grand’Eury.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>These conclusions require some modification when applied
    to British representatives of the arborescent Lycopodiales.
    The long spreading and dichotomously branched root-like organs
    attached to the base of Sigillarian and Lepidodendron stems
    are true examples of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> or other species. <i>Stigmariopsis</i>
    occurs but rarely. This marked difference between
    French and English specimens may be explained if we adopt
    the opinion of Solms-Laubach, who believes that the true
    <i>Stigmaria</i> represents both the parent rhizome and the later-formed
    roots of the Rhytidolepis Sigillarian species and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, the <i>Stigmariopsis</i> form having the corresponding
    relation to the Leiodermarian-Clathrarian species.</p>

  <p>The opinion expressed by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> in 1892 that Grand’Eury’s
    hypothesis “appears to be identical with the vague and
    speculative guesses that were prevalent among us in the early
    years of the present [nineteenth] century” illustrates the
    strength of conviction based on English specimens as to the
    root-nature of <i>Stigmaria</i>.</p>

  <p>There is undoubtedly considerable confusion, which can be
    cleared up only by further research, as to the precise relation
    between <i>Stigmaria</i> and <i>Stigmariopsis</i> on the one hand and the
    different types of <i>Sigillariae</i> on the other. The main contention,
    and this is the most important point, of Renault, Grand’Eury
    and Solms-Laubach as to the manner of formation of the aerial
    shoots from rhizomes and the subsequent production of forked
    roots and their ultimate separation from the parent rhizome
    is, as I believe, correct. Williamson held that <i>Stigmaria</i> must
    be regarded as a true root; he found no evidence to support
    the view that the large rooted stem discovered by Hawshaw,
    Binney, and others had been originally produced from aquatic
    rhizomes. It must, however, be remembered that Grand’Eury’s
    opinion is based on evidence afforded by the exceptionally well
    displayed Sigillarian forests of St Étienne, on a scale such as
    English strata have not as yet afforded. Moreover, the absence
    of any parent-rhizome in association with the rooted stumps
    described by Williamson and by others is not a serious argument
    against their rhizome origin.</p>

  <p>The specimen represented in <a href="#fig209">fig. 209</a>, which was examined
    <i>in situ</i> by Solms-Laubach and Grand’Eury, shows a Sigillarian
    stem in the Syringodendron condition bearing rows of paired
    parichnos scars; from the base forked and rapidly tapering
    arms radiate through the surrounding rock and, as shown by
    other specimens, these bear numerous appendages like those of
    the English Stigmarias. The surface-features of the arms are
    those of <i>Stigmariopsis</i> and the centre of each, as seen on the
    broken face, is occupied by a pith-cast characterised by parallel
    longitudinal ridges resembling those on the medullary casts of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span><i>Calamites</i>. It is noteworthy that the petrified rhizome originally
    described by Renault as <i>Stigmaria flexuosa</i>, and afterwards
    identified by him as the subterranean system of <i>Sigillaria
    Brardi</i>, possesses a vascular cylinder composed of primary xylem
    strands of crescentic transverse section lining the pith; a cast
    of the pith, after the removal by decay of its delicate parenchymatous
    tissue, would exhibit the surface-features of <i>Stigmariopsis</i>.
    <i>Stigmaria flexuosa</i> no doubt represents a true <i>Stigmariopsis</i>
    rhizome. On the other hand, as Williamson has shown,
    the inner surface of the wood of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> consists of
    a reticulum of xylem with meshes of medullary-ray tissue; a
    cast of such a surface presents a very different appearance from
    that of <i>Stigmariopsis</i>.</p>

  <p>Returning to <a href="#fig209">fig. 209</a>: from the lower surface of the <i>Stigmariopsis</i>
    arms numerous conical outgrowths, reaching a length
    of several centimetres, project vertically downwards; these also
    possess Stigmariopsis pith-casts and are identical with the
    “tap-roots” of Richard Brown. The stump seen in <a href="#fig209">fig. 209</a>
    shows the characteristic hollow base of the erect stem: this is
    the region which, it is believed, represents the position of the
    Stigmarian rhizome from which the aerial shoot was developed.
    Although no remains of the parent rhizome were found, traces
    of the rootlets which probably belonged to it were found in the
    neighbourhood. The absence of the actual rhizome is, however,
    not surprising as it would not persist after its aerial Sigillarian
    branches had attained independence by the development of their
    own dichotomously branched absorbing and holdfast organs.</p>

  <p>The Stigmarian axes of Palaeozoic Lycopods are compared
    by Miss Thomas<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> with the prop-roots of certain recent flowering
    plants which grow in tropical tidal swamps; their roots grow
    downwards from the stem at an angle of 50°-60° before
    spreading out horizontally. This author also makes some
    interesting suggestions in regard to the evidence afforded by
    anatomical structure as to the habitat of <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

  <h6><i>Anatomy.</i></h6>

  <p>The more important anatomical features of <i>Stigmaria</i> must
    be dealt with briefly. Williamson’s monograph, published in
    1887<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>, is considerably in advance of the work of that of any of
    the numerous writers who had previously dealt with the
    subject. The diagrammatic transverse section reproduced in fig.
    210, H, illustrates the general arrangement of the tissues. The
    medullated stele was described by Williamson as consisting
    entirely of centrifugally developed secondary xylem and
    distinguished, therefore, from the stele of a <i>Lepidodendron</i> or
    <i>Sigillaria</i> by the absence of a centripetally produced primary
    xylem zone. The secondary xylem tracheae are characterised
    by scalariform pits on both radial and tangential walls and, as
    shown in a figure given by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>, the spaces between
    the transverse bars are bridged across by fine threads, as in
    the tracheae of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p>One of the largest specimens of a petrified <i>Stigmaria</i> which
    I have seen is one lent to me by Mr Lomax from the Coal-Measures
    of Halifax in which the flattened transverse section
    measures 18 cm. × 3·5 cm., the cylinder of wood being 1·1 cm. ×
    7 mm. in diameter.</p>

  <p>In French examples of <i>Stigmaria</i> or <i>Stigmariopsis</i> it has
    been demonstrated by Renault<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> that primary xylem strands
    occur very like those in the stem of some species of <i>Sigillariae</i>
    (see p. 219). If a well-preserved section of an English <i>Stigmaria</i>
    is examined it will be seen that the edge of the secondary wood
    consists of a few narrower elements which do not exhibit the
    radial seriation characteristic of secondary elements.</p>

  <p>A type of <i>Stigmaria</i> characterised by centripetal primary
    wood has been described by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> and referred by him to
    <i>Bothrodendron mundum</i>; the main results of his observations are
    stated in the account of <i>Bothrodendron</i> on a subsequent page.
    This discovery is of considerable interest not only as rendering
    our knowledge of <i>Bothrodendron</i> remarkably complete but as
    confirmatory of Renault’s account of French Stigmarian axes in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>which centripetal primary wood is well developed between the
    secondary xylem and the centre of the stele. The Stigmarian
    axis of Bothrodendron was originally figured by Williamson
    as <i>Lepidodendron mundum</i><a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. The chief difference between
    Weiss’s specimen and those described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> as the
    Stigmarian axes of <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i>, is that in the English plant
    the centripetal wood forms a cylinder of uniform breadth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>instead of a band with a crenulated inner margin as figured by
    Renault.</p>

  </div>

  <p>An interesting agreement between the French and English
    specimens is the occurrence in the cortex of groups of reticulate
    elements: in Weiss’s section these are short and wide and
    occur in the middle cortex; in Renault’s plant they are more
    fusiform and occur in the secondary cortical tissue. These
    elements appear to have been arranged as an interlacing
    network in the middle cortex and were in close connexion with
    the rootlet-bundles, comparable, as Weiss points out, with the
    transfusion tracheids accompanying Lepidodendron leaf-traces.</p>

  <p>It is probable that these short and wide tracheal elements
    served for water-storage and thus afford another indication of the
    xerophilous character of the Carboniferous Lycopods, a feature
    possibly connected with a salt-marsh habitat.</p>

  <p>The presence of conspicuous medullary rays gives the
    secondary xylem of <i>Stigmaria</i> the appearance of being divided
    into several more or less distinct groups (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, E, <i>St</i>). In
    tangential longitudinal section the xylem assumes the form of
    a broad reticulum with lenticular meshes filled with medullary-ray
    tissue through which strands of xylem are cut across in a
    transverse direction as they pass outwards from the inner edge
    of the wood to supply the rootlets. In addition to these broader
    or primary medullary rays, there were numerous secondary
    rays composed of narrow plates of parenchymatous cells one
    or several elements in depth. As Williamson pointed out, the
    medullary-ray tissue consists in part of radially elongated
    tracheal elements with spiral or scalariform thickening bands like
    those described in the same position in Lepidodendron stems.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the minute structure of the tissues
    abutting on the secondary xylem is far from complete.</p>

  <p>The xylem is succeeded by a zone of delicate cells which was
    the seat of meristematic activity. It is noteworthy that in a
    section figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> there is the same disparity in
    size between the outermost elements of the xylem and the
    adjacent cells of the meristematic zone as in Lepidodendron
    stems. Beyond this region an imperfectly preserved lacunar
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>tissue occurs like that which I have called the secretory zone in
    Lepidodendron stems; but information as to the structure of
    this part of <i>Stigmaria</i> is much more incomplete than in the
    case of the aerial shoots. The middle cortex was of the same
    lacunar type as in the stems, and the fact that it is never well
    preserved in large Stigmarian axes suggests that it may have
    been even more richly supplied than in the aerial stems with an
    aerating system of spaces. The outer cortex, consisting in young
    examples of large-celled parenchyma, became at an early stage
    of growth the seat of cambial activity which resulted in the
    production of radially placed series of secondary elements (fig.
    210, H, <i>p</i>). The outer and older elements of this secondary
    cortex are more tangentially stretched than the inner cells, a
    necessary result of the position of the phellogen on the internal
    edge of the tissue and of the increasing girth of the axis.</p>

  <p>In comparatively young Stigmarian axes the outer cortex
    already possesses a band of secondary radially disposed cells
    characterised by the greater tangential extension of the more
    external elements; usually this tissue terminates abruptly on
    the inner edge and the line of separation no doubt marks the
    position of the phellogen. Occasionally some delicate secondary
    elements are preserved internal to the phellogen, and these in
    young specimens form a narrow cylinder composed in part of
    radially elongated cells showing signs of recent tangential
    divisions. In its earlier stage of activity the phellogen seems to
    form a greater amount of secondary tissue on the outside, but
    this is clearly not of the nature of cork, the tissue which occupies
    a corresponding position in recent plants. The primary cortex
    shows no signs of shrinkage or collapse as would be the case
    were it cut off from the vascular system by a zone of impermeable
    cork.</p>

  <p><a href="#fig210">Fig. 210</a>, G, represents a piece of the external tissue of a
    specimen in which the slightly flattened xylem cylinder
    measures 1·4 × 1 cm.; the inner cortex has disappeared and
    fragments only of the middle cortex are preserved. The outer
    cortex, with an average breadth of 2 mm., consists superficially of
    primary parenchyma with a somewhat uneven surface and with
    a rootlet attached here and there; a short distance below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
    surface is a band of conspicuous cells, <i>b</i>, characterised by dark
    contents suggesting very imperfectly preserved fungal hyphae,
    but the nature of the substance filling the cells cannot be made
    out with certainty. It is, however, interesting to find that this
    dark band constitutes an obvious feature (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a> H, <i>b</i>); its position is
    comparable with that of the dark-walled cells in the outer
    cortex of rootlets. A short distance internal to this dark band
    tangentially elongated cells form the outermost elements of the
    secondary cortex; these become gradually narrower towards the
    interior and pass into radial series of smaller cells of uniform size,
    as seen on the inner edge of <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, G. At the inner boundary
    of this tissue, just below the region shown at the bottom of the
    drawing, was situated the phellogen. Such traces of tissue as
    occur on the inner side of the line where splitting has usually
    occurred, consist of thinner elements with recently formed
    tangential walls and probably represent an early stage in the
    development of phelloderm.</p>

  <p>A much older section is shown in part in <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, E. The
    secondary xylem cylinder, <i>St</i>, is shown in the lower part of the
    section; beyond this is a band of secondary tissue which reaches
    in some places a breadth of 6 cm. The greater part of this
    tissue consists of phelloderm of very uniform structure made up
    of radial series of cells: this is interrupted in most parts of the
    section by a gap crowded with intruded rootlets (a portion of
    this is enlarged in <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, D). Beyond this gap the secondary
    tissue consists of radial series of cells characterised by the
    considerable tangential elongation of many of the elements,
    precisely like the tissue figured by Williamson. In all probability
    the gap represents a line of weakness due to the
    phellogen, and if this is the case it is clear that in an old
    <i>Stigmaria</i> the phelloderm exceeded in amount the tissue formed
    external to the phellogen. The secondary tissue on the inner
    side of the phellogen is characterised by numerous irregular
    concentric lines superficially resembling rings of growth in the
    wood of a Conifer: these are, however, not the result of any
    periodic change in external conditions, but are apparently due
    to crushing of the tissue and are possibly, to some extent, the
    result of the presence of secretory strands like those in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
    phelloderm of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The surface of this older rhizome
    retains patches of primary tissue, and an occasional rootlet, as at
    <i>r</i>, <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, E, is seen in connexion with the cortex; the cortex
    has been vertically fissured as the result of secondary growth
    and presents an appearance like that shown in <i>Lepidodendron
    Wünschianum</i> and <i>L. Veltheimianum</i> (figs. <a href="#fig181">181</a>, A, and <a href="#fig186">186</a>, A).</p>

  <p>The form in which a Stigmarian rootlet is usually preserved
    is shown in <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, D; the single vascular bundle strand with
    its endarch protoxylem (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, B, <i>px</i>) is enclosed by a ring of
    inner cortical parenchyma (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, F, <i>c</i><sup>1</sup>); the cells in immediate
    contact with the xylem having usually disappeared. Beyond
    the middle cortical space a second cylinder of parenchyma
    represents the outer cortex (F, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>) in which a layer of dark-walled
    cells (<i>b</i>, <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, F) may be compared with the hypodermal
    band in the main Stigmarian axis (G, <i>b</i>). These
    Stigmarian rootlets, usually less than 1 cm. in diameter, are the
    commonest objects in sections of the calcareous nodules from
    English coal-seams. A good example of their abundance is
    shown in <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, D and E; here they have invaded the space
    formed by the splitting of the secondary cortical tissues along
    the line of the phellogen and a few are seen here and there in the
    deeper layers of the phelloderm (<i>s</i>, <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, E). Not infrequently
    the close contact of these ubiquitous rootlets with the tissues of
    the plant which they have invaded leads to confusion between
    invader and invaded. Partially decayed tissues lying, probably,
    under water were penetrated by Stigmarian rootlets in exactly
    the same way as the roots of recent plants bore through vegetable
    substances which happen to be in their path. The rootlet
    bundles are in the first instance composed of the primary tracheae
    which line the inner edge of the secondary xylem; these receive
    additions from the meristematic zone, and thus, when seen in
    the cortex outside the stelar region, are found to consist in part
    of primary and in part of a fan-shaped group of secondary
    tracheae. On the other hand, the monarch bundle as it
    appears in a free rootlet is usually composed entirely of
    primary elements (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, A–C, F). It has been shown by
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> that in the Stigmarian rhizome of what is probably
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span><i>Lepidodendron fuliginosum</i>, the rootlet bundle is accompanied
    by a parichnos strand, but this has not been detected in the
    ordinary <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>. When free from the parent axis a
    rootlet usually consists of an outer cylinder of cortex enclosing
    a broad space in which remnants of lacunar tissue are sometimes
    seen. The relation of the external features of a well-preserved
    Stigmarian rootlet-scar to the internal structure of a
    petrified rootlet is very clearly seen on comparing such sections
    as those represented in <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, D, with the form of the scar on
    a Stigmarian cast. A specimen figured by Hooker<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> in 1848
    affords a good illustration of the structure of a rootlet-base as
    seen in an unusually complete cast; this correlation of anatomical
    and surface features is clearly described also by
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>. It is probable that
    even during life the rootlets were hollow for a part at least
    of their length as are the roots of <i>Isoetes</i> (<a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, G).</p>

  <p>An interesting discovery was made a few years ago which
    confirmed a statement by Renault which Williamson was
    unable to accept, namely that the xylem bundle of a rootlet
    occasionally gives off a delicate tracheal strand at right angles
    to the long axis of a rootlet. In some rootlets Weiss<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> found
    obliquely running delicate strands of xylem, surrounded by a
    layer of parenchymatous tissue, in the space between the
    vascular bundle and the outer cortical cylinder. It is clear
    that a few spiral tracheids are occasionally given off from the
    protoxylem of a rootlet bundle: these follow an oblique course
    to the outer cortex, where in some cases they have been traced
    into connexion with short and spirally marked cells resembling
    transfusion tracheae (<a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, A). This arrangement may serve
    as a means of facilitating the passage of water absorbed by the
    superficial cells into the xylem strand. It should be noticed
    that, like roots of recent water-plants, the rootlets of <i>Stigmaria</i>
    had no root-hairs. Fig. 210, F, shows a transverse section of
    part of a rootlet in which the outer cortical cylinder, <i>c</i><sup>3</sup>, is
    connected, as in the roots of <i>Isoetes</i>, with the sheath surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
    the vascular bundle. A few obliquely cut tracheae are
    seen in this section traversing the connecting band of parenchyma
    <i>t</i>, <a href="#fig210">fig. 210</a>, A.</p>

  <p>A point of biological interest in connexion with Stigmaria
    rootlets is the occasional presence of hypertrophied cells, the
    large size of which is due to the attacks of a fungus named by
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> <i>Urophlyctites stigmariae</i>.</p>

  <p>In addition to <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>, which is by far the
    commonest form, a few other species have been founded on
    external characters. One of these is represented by <i>Stigmaria
    stellata</i>, Goepp.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>, characterised by the presence of radially disposed
    ridges and small tubercles surrounding each rootlet-scar.
    Kidston refers to Goeppert’s species as a Lower Carboniferous
    type. We have no evidence as to the meaning of the stellate
    ridges and tubercles, nor have we any reason to suppose that
    this form differed essentially in structure from <i>Stigmaria
    ficoides</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Bothrodendron"><i>Bothrodendron.</i> <a href="#fig211">Figs. 211–216</a>.</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">Although</span> in many respects the genus <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    agrees very closely in habit and in its anatomical features with
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, there are reasons for referring it to a distinct
    family of Palaeozoic Lycopods. As the following description
    shows, the external features do not differ in any essential points
    from those of certain types of the genus <i>Sigillaria</i>, particularly
    such a species as <i>S. rimosa</i>, Gold.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>, which has recently been
    refigured and described by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> from Goldenberg’s type-specimen
    in the Stockholm Museum. The small size of
    the leaf-scars is, however, a characteristic feature of <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, F); but a more important point is the
    fact that in a recently described<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> English example of a cone of
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> (<a href="#fig216">fig. 216</a>), the sporangia are very like those of
    recent Lycopods, and differ from the radially elongated sporangia
    of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>. On the other hand, a French cone
    described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> as <i>Lepidostrobus Olryi</i>, which is probably
    a strobilus of <i>Bothrodendron</i>, has the radially elongated type
    of sporangium (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, E). The comparative abundance of
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> in Lower Carboniferous and Devonian rocks
    points to the greater antiquity of this member of the Lycopodiales
    as compared with <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

  <p>The name <i>Bothrodendron</i> was instituted by Lindley and
    Hutton<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> for impressions of stems from the English Coal-Measures,
    characterised by two opposite rows of large depressions
    like those shown in <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a> and, in one of the
    specimens, by “a considerable number of minute dots, arranged
    in a quincuncial manner.” The minute dots were recognised
    as leaf-scars and the cup-like cavities were described as probably
    connected with the occurrence of large cones. On very slender
    evidence this Palaeozoic plant, which was named <i>Bothrodendron
      punctatum</i>, was considered by these authors as probably a
    member of the Coniferales. The large stem from the Coal-Measures
    in the neighbourhood of Mons, Belgium, shown in
    <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a>, affords a good illustration of <i>Bothrodendron</i> in a partially
    decorticated condition, exhibiting a row of depressions similar to
    those on the Ulodendron form of <i>Lepidodendron Veltheimianum</i>
    (<a href="#fig157">fig. 157</a>), but distinguished by the eccentric position of the
    scar at the bottom of each cup-shaped cavity: in the Belgian
    specimen, which is partially decorticated and shows the leaf-traces
    as small dots, the depressions have a diameter of 9 cm. It is
    believed by some authors that these Ulodendron shoots of
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i> owe their characteristic
    appearance to the pressure of large cones, but, as I have already
    stated, there are reasons for preferring the view that these
    crater-like hollows are the scars of deciduous branches. Our
    knowledge of the strobili borne by Bothrodendron stems is
    still meagre, but we have no reason to assume the existence of
    any cones large enough to produce by the pressure of their
    bases such depressions as those shown in <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a>. In one species
    at least the strobili were borne terminally on slender shoots
    (<a href="#fig213">fig. 213</a>). The Ulodendron condition has so far been recognised
    in one species only, <i>B. punctatum</i>.</p>

  <p>In his catalogue of Palaeozoic plants, Kidston<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> included
    <i>Bothrodendron punctatum</i> as a synonym of <i>Sigillaria discophora</i>
    König, a mistake which he afterwards rectified<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>: the generic
    name <i>Bothrodendron</i> was generally ignored by authors in the
    belief that the specimens described by Lindley and Hutton
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>were not generically distinct from the fossils originally figured
    by Rhode as <i>Ulodendron</i>. It was Prof. Zeiller who first
    demonstrated that the English authors were justified in their
    choice of a new designation for stems with large depressions
    in association with minute leaf-scars. In 1859 Haughton<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
    proposed a new family name Cyclostigmaceae for some Upper
    Devonian plants from County Kilkenny, Ireland: he described
    three species of his new genus <i>Cyclostigma</i>, <i>Cyclostigma
      kiltorkense, C. minutum</i>, and <i>C. Griffithsi</i>; these are now generally
    recognised as a single species of <i>Bothrodendron</i>, though, as
    Nathorst suggests, the Irish plant should perhaps be separated
    as a sub-genus <i>Bothrodendron</i> (<i>Cyclostigma</i>) by reason of certain
    minor differences which distinguish it from other species of
    the genus.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Another generic name, <i>Rhytidodendron</i>, was instituted by
    Boulay in 1876 for stems characterised by a finely wrinkled
    bark and small spirally disposed leaf-scars. A short description
    of this type, which occurs in the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures,
    may serve to illustrate the external features of
    the commonest British example of the genus.</p>

  <p>In habit a plant of <i>Bothrodendron</i> recalls <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and recent species of <i>Lycopodium</i>; the slender dichotomously
    branched twigs bearing numerous leaves (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, D), have
    been mistaken for shoots of <i>Lycopodium</i>, and fragments of
    branches might well be identified as impressions of Mosses.
    The leaf-scars on the smaller shoots occur on elongated cushions
    (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, C, D) with a transversely wrinkled surface; on the
    older branches the leaf-scars are separated by fairly large areas
    of bark characterised by sinuous transverse grooves and narrow
    ridges bearing numerous small pits, as shown on an enlarged
    scale in <a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, A. The original surface-features are shown
    on the left of the drawing, and a slightly deeper level in the
    cortex is represented on the right-hand side. The absence of
    leaf-cushions on the older shoots is probably the result of
    secondary thickening, which also alters the size and shape
    of the leaf-scars. Each scar has three pits on its surface, as
    in <i>Lepidodendron</i>; a central leaf-trace scar and lateral parichnos
    scars. The circular pit above the leaf-scars, which occurs in
    most species, marks the position of the ligule. The relation of
    the short leaves, 5 mm. long, to the leaf-cushions is shown in
    <a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, D. The absence of leaves, except in impressions of
    slender twigs, may be interpreted as an indication that they
    were shed at an early stage and did not persist many years.
    The leaf-cushions of the smaller shoots of <i>Bothrodendron
    minutifolium</i> closely resemble those figured by Weiss on a
    Devonian plant, <i>Lepidodendron Losseni</i><a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>.</p>

  <p>One of the few examples so far discovered of a Bothrodendron
    cone is shown in <a href="#fig213">fig. 213</a>; this specimen, at least 10 cm.
    long, was found by Mr Hemingway in the Middle Coal-Measures
    of Yorkshire and described by Dr Kidston. Numerous sporophylls
    are attached at right angles to the axis, the surface of
    which is protected by their upturned distal portions; the arrangement
    of the parts appears to be the same as in <i>Lepidostrobus</i>.
    A specimen figured by Zeiller as <i>Lepidostrobus Olryi</i>, which
    Kidston is probably correct in identifying with <i>Bothrodendron
    minutifolium</i>, shows that each sporophyll carries a horizontally
    elongated sporangium (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, E).</p>

  <p>This species, which is less abundant than <i>B. minutifolium</i>,
    in British Coal-Measures, has been described by several authors
    as <i>Ulodendron</i> on account of the occurrence of large depressions,
    like those shown in <a href="#fig211">fig. 211</a>, on certain branches of the plant.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>At the suggestion of Dr Kidston, Prof. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> figured an
    English specimen of this species, presented to the Paris
    Museum by Mr Hutton, in which the leaf-scars are preserved
    on the bark of a stem with Ulodendron scars. The surface of
    the bark is characterised by numerous small pits and discontinuous
    vertical lines in contrast to the transverse lines of
    <i>B. minutifolium</i> (cf. <a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, A and F). The leaf-scars on the
    smaller shoots may have a diameter of only 0·3–0·5 mm., while
    on the larger branches they reach a breadth of 1 mm. The
    ligule-pit may be in contact with the upper edge (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, F)
    of the leaf-scar or separated from it by a short distance.</p>

  <p>The specimens from the Upper Devonian rocks of Co.
    Kilkenny on which Haughton founded this and two other
    species may be regarded as representing one specific type. He
    described the circular leaf-scars as arranged in alternating
    whorls. In habit the Irish species agrees with <i>Bothrodendron
    minutifolium</i>, but the leaf-scars are more elliptical (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, H)
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>and the ligule-pit is usually absent. The leaf-scar shown in
    fig. H is 1·2 mm. broad and 1·4 mm. in height. The large
    collection obtained during the visit of a Swedish expedition to
    Bear Island in 1898 under the leadership of Dr Nathorst has
    materially increased our knowledge of this ancient type. The
    form of the leaf-scars varies according to the age of the branch
    and their disposition is far from constant even on the same
    specimen; in some cases the scars are in fairly regular
    whorls (<a href="#fig212">fig. 212</a>, G; an Irish specimen) while in others they are
    in regular spirals. This irregularity of arrangement, which is
    well illustrated by Nathorst’s figures of Bear Island and Irish
    specimens, finds its counterpart, though in a less marked form,
    in recent species of <i>Lycopodium</i>, <i>e.g. L. Selago</i>. Partially
    decorticated stems may present a superficial resemblance to
    <i>Calamites</i>, the fissured bark simulating the ribs of a Calamitean
    cast. Such stems, as Nathorst has pointed out, were mistaken
    by Heer for <i>Calamites radiatus</i>. The smaller branches are
    characterised by a smooth surface, and older shoots resemble
    <i>Bothrodendron minutifolium</i> in the presence of fine vertical
    lines. The preservation of only one pit on the leaf-scars of
    many examples led authors to conclude that the species is
    peculiar in this respect, but Nathorst has shown that in more
    perfectly preserved specimens each leaf-scar bears three small
    dots. A specimen from Ireland in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> illustrates
    the dichotomous branching and the longitudinal wrinkling
    of the bark; the leaf-scars are 2 mm. broad and 2·5 mm. deep.</p>

  <p>Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> has described some examples in which the leaf-scars
    occur on the lower instead of on the upper end of the
    leaf-cushions; these and other specimens with obscure surface-features
    he suggests may be underground axes, comparable
    in habit with <i>Stigmaria</i> though not identical as regards
    details. It is pointed out that the absence or scarcity of
    <i>Stigmaria</i> in the Bear Island beds renders it unlikely that
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> bore typical Stigmaria branches. F. E. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
    has recently described root-bearing organs possessing primary
    xylem identical with that of <i>Bothrodendron mundum</i>; while
    closely resembling <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> in certain anatomical
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>characters, they clearly represent a distinct type. This discovery
    of a Stigmaria-like axis almost certainly belonging to
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> is consistent with Nathorst’s views on some of
    the Bothrodendron impressions from Bear Island.</p>

  <p>Information as to the cones of this species is restricted to a
    description by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> of a specimen in the Dublin Museum
    as <i>Lepidostrobus Bailyanus</i>; this has sporophylls with a subtriangular
    base bearing several megaspores and terminating
    distally in a slender lamina 12 cm. in length.</p>

  <p>An example of a <i>Bothrodendron</i> with more prominent leaf-cushions
    than those already mentioned is afforded by a species
    from Bear Island described by Heer<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> as <i>Lepidodendron
    Wükianum</i> and afterwards referred by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> to <i>Bothrodendron</i>.
    The same type is recorded also by Schmalhausen<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
    from Lower Carboniferous or Devonian strata of Siberia.
    Certain Scotch specimens from the Calciferous Sandstone, which
    Kidston<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> referred to Heer’s species, are regarded by Nathorst and,
    in part at least, by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and Sterzel as representing a distinct
    species which these authors designate <i>Bothrodendron Kidstoni</i><a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>.</p>

  <p>Without attempting the hopeless task of discriminating
    between the various Carboniferous and Devonian specimens
    described under the names <i>Cyclostigma</i> or <i>Bothrodendron</i>,
    reference may be made to the following records as illustrating
    the wide distribution of the genus. Schmalhausen<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> records
    <i>Cyclostigma kiltorkense</i> from Siberian rocks assigned to the
    Ursa stage (Devonian or Lower Carboniferous). The fossil
    described by Dawson<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> from the Devonian of Gaspé as <i>Cyclostigma
    densifolium</i> probably represents a badly preserved
    example of <i>Bothrodendron</i>: Weiss’s species <i>Cyclostigma hercynium</i><a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
    from Lower Devonian rocks of the Hartz district may be
    identical with <i>Bothrodendron kiltorkense</i>. The supposed identity
    of the latter species with <i>Dechenia Roemeriana</i> Goepp., as described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
    by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>, appears to require confirmation<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>, but if this
    author is correct the connexion demonstrates the continuity of
    Bothrodendron shoots and Stigmaria-like subterranean organs.
    The specimens described from South Africa, from strata which
    may be correlated with the Upper or possibly with the Lower
    Carboniferous series of Europe, as <i>Bothrodendron Leslei</i><a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> in all
    probability represents a species closely allied to the Irish and
    Bear Island type. <i>Bothrodendron Leslei</i> named after Mr Leslie
    whose discoveries in the Carboniferous Sandstone of Vereeniging
    (Transvaal) have added considerably to our knowledge of
    the South African Palaeozoic types, is represented by imperfectly
    preserved casts characterised by more or less circular
    scars displaying the same irregularity of arrangement as
    in <i>Bothrodendron kiltorkense</i>. The leaf-scars appear to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>have only one small pit, but this may not be an original
    feature. The identification of this plant as <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    receives support from the discovery of rather more satisfactory
    specimens at Witteberg sent to me for examination by
    Dr Schwarz<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. These fossils bear a striking resemblance to
    <i>B. kiltorkense</i>. <i>Cydostigma australe</i><a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Feist. described from
    the Lower Carboniferous rocks of New South Wales, though
    too imperfectly preserved to refer with confidence to <i>B. kiltorkense</i>,
    is no doubt a closely allied type.</p>

  <p>Reference was made in Volume I. (p. 133) to the so-called
    paper coal of Carboniferous age from Central Russia, which consists
    of masses of thin strips of cuticle of Bothrodendron stems.
    The figures published by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> show that the plant possessed
    an epidermis consisting of polygonal cells interrupted by spirally
    disposed gaps marking the position of leaves; the gaps measure
    0·5–1·5 mm. in breadth and agree, therefore, with the size of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>the leaf-scars of the smaller forms of <i>Bothrodendron</i>. The
    specimens from the Russian mines were first figured by
    Trautschold and Auerbach<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> as <i>Lepidodendron tenerrimum</i> and
    afterwards referred by Zeiller to <i>Bothrodendron punctatum</i><a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.
    Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>, however, states that an examination of the Russian
    material leads him to retain the name originally proposed; he
    records the same type from Upper Devonian rocks of Spitzbergen.
    The chief interest of these Russian specimens is their
    manner of preservation, which Renault has described as the
    result of bacterial action; he claims to have recognised the
    actual bacteria associated with the cuticular membranes<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="Anatomy"><i>Anatomy of vegetative shoots</i> of Bothrodendron.</h5>

  <p>In 1889 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> described several specimens of petrified
    shoots from the Coal-Measures of Halifax which he named
    <i>Lepidodendron mundum</i>: these are now known to be branches
    of a <i>Bothrodendron</i>. The discovery was made by Mr Lomax<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
    who found specimens showing the external characters of <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    and the anatomical characters of <i>Lepidodendron
    mundum</i>. In some of the smaller twigs, the stele consists of a
    solid core of xylem with external protoxylem; but in the
    majority of specimens the centre of the xylem is replaced by
    parenchymatous tissue, either as a small axial strand or, as in
    the specimen shown in <a href="#fig215">fig. 215</a>, D, a wide pith, the elements of
    which are arranged in regular vertical series. A diagrammatic
    section of a small axis is represented in <a href="#fig215">fig. 215</a>, A: this branch,
    2 mm. in diameter, is composed of a broad outer cortex consisting
    exclusively of primary tissue the outer cells of which
    are smaller and have thicker walls than the more internal
    elements. The leaf-traces, <i>lt</i>, are accompanied by a strand of
    delicate tissue, the parichnos. The stele is almost solid; the
    tissues in contact with the xylem have not been preserved but
    the inner cortex is represented by a few layers of small parenchymatous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
    cells, <i>c</i><sup>1</sup>. The larger section shown in <a href="#fig215">fig. 215</a>, D,
    was cut from a specimen from Dulesgate of which the smooth
    surface exhibits the characteristic leaf-scars of <i>Bothrodendron</i>.
    The section measures 3 cm. in its longest diameter and the
    stele has a breadth of 3 mm. The outer cortex has a smooth
    surface and is composed of rather thick-walled cells succeeded
    by a zone of secondary elements. The middle cortex has
    disappeared and the space is partially occupied by Stigmarian
    rootlets, <i>s</i>, and crushed patches of cortical tissue. The position
    of a leaf-scar is seen at <i>a</i>; this is more clearly shown in the
    enlarged drawing fig. E.</p>

  <p>In his account of <i>Lepidodendron mundum</i>, Williamson<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> described
    a section in which the primary wood is surrounded
    by a considerable thickness of secondary xylem; a diagram of
    this is shown in <a href="#fig215">fig. 215</a>, C. An examination of the section led
    me to compare the structure of the outer cortical cells, characterised
    by radial rows of tangentially elongated elements, with
    the outer cortex of <i>Stigmaria</i>. It has recently been shown by
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> that this and other similar sections present several
    points of agreement with <i>Stigmaria</i>, particularly with <i>Stigmaria
    Brardi</i> as described by Renault. At <i>s</i> in <a href="#fig215">fig. 215</a>, C, a vascular
    strand is seen passing through the outer cortex; this is almost
    certainly the bundle of a rootlet: in the sections described by
    Weiss rootlets are shown in a similar position. The chief
    anatomical features of the Stigmaria-like organs of <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    are:—the considerable development of secondary xylem,
    the structure of the outer cortex, which is practically identical
    with that of <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i>, and the association of groups of
    short transfusion tracheids with the bundles of the rootlets. It
    is very probable that the absence of secondary xylem in the
    vegetative shoots of <i>Bothrodendron</i> is merely an accident and
    not a real distinction between the aerial and subterranean
    branches of the plant; a supposition rendered probable by the
    occurrence of secondary xylem in the axis of the cone described
    by Watson. As Weiss points out, there are certain differences
    between the true <i>Stigmaria</i> and the corresponding organ of
    <i>Bothrodendron</i>; the secondary xylem in <i>Bothrodendron</i> is not
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>broken up by broad medullary rays as in the common <i>Stigmaria</i>,
    and in <i>Bothrodendron</i> the occurrence of a ring of primary xylem
    is another peculiarity.</p>

  <p>In the vegetative shoots of <i>Bothrodendron mundum</i> the
    stele differs from those of <i>Lepidodendron</i> in the narrower
    primary xylem ring and in the large size of the metaxylem
    tracheae; from <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii</i> and <i>L. fuliginosum</i>
    the xylem is distinguished by its smoother outer face which
    consists of numerous narrow xylem elements.</p>

  <h5 id="Cones_of_Bothrodendron"><i>Cones</i> of Bothrodendron (<i>Bothrostrobus</i><a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>).</h5>

  <p>The long and narrow cones referred to <i>Bothrodendron
      minutifolium</i> from English and French Coal-Measures are known
    only as impressions and it is not possible to say whether they
    were heterosporous or homosporous; the drawing given by
    Zeiller (Fig. 212, E) shows that the sporangia were of the same
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>form as those in <i>Lepidostrobus</i>, but we have no more exact
    information as to their morphology. A recently published
    description of a petrified strobilus by Mr Watson affords a
    welcome addition to our knowledge. There is little doubt that
    this cone was borne by a species of <i>Bothrodendron</i>; the evidence
    for this conclusion is supplied by the agreement of the anatomical
    characters of the stele with that of the vegetative shoots
    originally described by Williamson as <i>Lepidodendron mundum</i>
    and by the constant association of the cones and vegetative
    shoots. In 1880 Williamson described a crushed cone containing
    both megaspores and microspores which he spoke of as “a diminutive
    organism, reminding us more of the dwarfed fruits of
    many living Selaginellas than of the large <i>Lepidostrobi</i><a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>.”
    Watson’s specimens enable us to give a more complete account
    of this type. The axis of the strobilus bears short sporophylls
    bent upwards into a distal limb with a conspicuous ligule in a
    deep pit beyond the shortly stalked sporangium. The length of
    the strobilus is estimated at 10 mm.; the stele is of the same
    type as that of <i>Bothrodendron mundum</i>, but it differs from the
    specimens of the vegetative shoots so far found in having some
    secondary xylem. As shown in the sketch reproduced in <a href="#fig216">fig. 216</a>
    each sporophyll is characterised by two tangentially placed
    grooves, <i>g</i>, on the lower face, and by numerous transfusion
    tracheids, <i>tr</i>, above the vascular bundle, <i>vb</i>, immediately below
    the ligule, <i>l</i>. Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on the
    same cone, the megasporangia being on the lower sporophylls
    and containing a single tetrad of megaspores. Fig. 219, E, shows
    a radial longitudinal section of a microsporophyll bearing a
    sporangium on the adaxial side of the ligule, <i>l</i>, below which is
    the single vascular bundle and a group of short tracheids at <i>t</i>.
    The sporangia closely resemble those of species of <i>Selaginella</i>
    and <i>Lycopodium</i> and, as pointed out by Watson<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>, they also
    recall the sporangia of the Palaeozoic genus <i>Spencerites</i>. <i>Bothrostrobus</i>
    is distinguished from <i>Spencerites</i> by the presence of
    a ligule, by the structure of the axis, and by the different form
    of the sporophylls. The occurrence of four spores only in the
    megasporangia is another character in which the extinct type
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>resembles recent Lycopods. It is impossible to decide whether
    Watson’s cone represents a more or a less primitive type than
    <i>Lepidostrobus</i>: if we accept Professor Bower’s views in regard
    to the evolution of vegetative organs by the sterilisation of
    sporogenous tissue, we should probably place <i>Lepidostrobus</i> lower
    in the series than <i>Bothrostrobus</i>; but the greater resemblance
    between the fertile and vegetative shoots of <i>Bothrodendron</i>, as
    compared with the more pronounced difference in the case of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, may be regarded as an argument in favour of
    recognising <i>Bothrodendron</i> as the more primitive type.</p>

  <p>Another possible example of a <i>Bothrodendron</i> cone has been
    described by Nathorst from Spitzbergen as <i>Lepidostrobus</i>
    <i>Zeilleri</i><a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>; this appears to consist of an axis bearing spirally
    disposed sporangia without any indication of sporophylls. This
    strobilus may belong to <i>Bothrodendron tenerrimum</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Pinakodendron"><i>Pinakodendron</i>.</h4>

  <p>The name <i>Pinakodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> was instituted by the late Prof.
    Weiss for a type of stem closely resembling <i>Bothrodendron</i> but
    differing in the presence of a fine reticulation on the outer bark
    and in the form of the leaf-scars. Weiss’s genus has been recognised
    by Kidston in Dumfriesshire but our knowledge of the
    plant is as yet based solely on a few small specimens.</p>

  <h4 id="Omphalophloios"><i>Omphalophloios</i> (<i>a genus of uncertain systematic position</i>).<br />
    Figs. <a href="#fig193">193</a>, C, <a href="#fig217">217</a>.</h4>

  <p>This generic name was instituted by White<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> for certain
    specimens of large stems originally described by Lesquereux
    from the Coal-Measures of North America as <i>Lepidodendron
    mammillatum</i> and <i>L. cyclostigma</i>. The photograph reproduced
    in <a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, C, for which I am indebted to Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>, represents
    a specimen described by him from the Upper Coal-Measures
    of Somerset as <i>Omphalophloios anglicus</i>, and identified with
    <i>Lepidodendron anglicum</i> of Sternberg.</p>

  <p>The surface of the impression shown in <a href="#fig193">fig. 193</a>, C, is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>characterised by clearly defined rhomboidal areas or cushions (fig.
    217, E) like those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, except in the absence of a
    median keel, and similar to those on some forms of <i>Sigillaria
    Brardi</i>. A short distance above the centre of each cushion is
    an oval or subcordate region bounded by a rim-like margin and
    containing a small oval scar, presumably that of a vascular strand.
    A triangular elevation which also shows a small pit (Fig. 217,
    E, <i>a</i>) occurs below the oval area. The appearance of the
    surface-features varies considerably on different parts of a single
    specimen. Fig. 217, D, represents one of the numerous figures
    published by White in his detailed account of the American
    material. Each cushion bears a widely open <span class="sans"><b>V</b></span>-shaped ridge,
    which is described as a leaf-scar; above this is an oval area (2·5
    mm. × 1·75 mm.), the surface of which is bounded by a narrow
    rim. Within the rim is a smaller concave oval region with a
    small pit near its upper end.</p>

      <i>Omphalophloios.</i> D. After White. E. After Kidston.</div>
  </div>

  <p>We cannot, in the absence of petrified material, arrive at
    any satisfactory conclusion as to the meaning of these surface-features.
    White considers that <i>Omphalophloios</i> is probably a
    rhizome of one of the arborescent Lycopods, but whether or
    not this is its true nature must be left for future discoveries.
    The fact that the rootlet bundles of some Stigmarian axes are
    accompanied by a parichnos strand, as Weiss has shown, may
    prepare us for the discovery of surface-features on <i>Stigmariae</i>
    not unlike those of <i>Omphalophloios</i>. (Fig. 193, C.)</p>

  <p>A possible comparison may be suggested also with <i>Sigillaria
    Brardi</i> as figured by Germar (<a href="#fig196">fig. 196</a>, A) in which circular
    scars, which may be the scars of rootlets, occur below the leaf-base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
    areas. It is not impossible that in the surface-features of
    <i>Omphalophloios</i> we have both leaf and rootlet scars represented.</p>

  <h4 id="General_considerations"><i>General considerations.</i></h4>

  <p>The solid xylem core characteristic of the stele of some
    species of Palaeozoic Lycopodiales (e.g. <i>Lepidodendron esnostense</i>
    and <i>L. rhodumnense</i>) may probably, as Tansley and Chick<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> point
    out, be regarded as the lineal descendant of a primitive axial
    strand of water-conducting elements. In the course of evolution
    the centre of the tracheal column became partially converted
    into parenchymatous tissue, as in <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>.
    The arrangement of the short cells in regular vertical series is
    reminiscent of an early stage in the development of tracheae:
    instead of forming tubular conducting elements the central
    part of the stelar meristem acquired the short-celled form;
    some of the cells became lignified as isodiametric storage tracheae
    while others persisted as thin-walled parenchyma.</p>

  <p>The production of secondary xylem and an increase in the
    girth of the whole stem led to reduction in the amount of centripetally
    developed conducting channels. Some of these assumed a
    new rôle and a shape in harmony with their functions. A later
    stage is represented by a further encroachment of the central
    parenchyma on the cylinder of centripetal xylem, as seen in
    <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii</i> and other species. The next stage
    is afforded by ribless species of <i>Sigillaria</i> in which the
    primary xylem is broken up into separate conducting strands.
    As Kidston<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> reminds us, it is in the geologically more recent
    species of <i>Sigillaria</i>, such as <i>S. Brardi</i>, which persist into the
    Permian era, that this more extreme case of reduction occurs.
    The older genus <i>Lepidodendron</i> seems to have retained to
    the last the complete cylinder of primary xylem. In the stele
    of <i>Stigmaria</i>, the rhizome of <i>Sigillaria</i> and of <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
    reduction of the centripetal xylem has passed beyond the stage
    represented by the broken cylinder of the ribless Sigillarias.
    With the exception of the examples described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and
    by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>, <i>Stigmaria</i> is characterised by little or no centripetal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>primary xylem. It is, however, noteworthy that Renault’s
    <i>Stigmaria</i>, in which centripetal xylem forms a prominent
    feature, is attributed to <i>Sigillaria Brardi</i>, a species in which
    the vascular cylinder of the aerial stem illustrates a later and
    not an earlier phase in the replacement of centripetal by
    centrifugal wood.</p>

  <p>It would seem, as Lady Isabel Browne<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> says, that most
    Stigmarian axes had reached a more advanced stage in
    specialisation than is shown in the stelar structure of the aerial
    shoots. The relatively greater and probably the more precocious
    development of secondary xylem in <i>Stigmaria</i> than in <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    or <i>Sigillaria</i> may have some significance in relation
    to the smaller amount of “old wood<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>” (in a phylogenetic sense)
    in their steles.</p>

  <p>As is pointed out in a later chapter, recent researches into
    the anatomy of extinct members of the Osmundaceae by
    Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan have brought to light a striking
    parallelism in evolutionary sequence between the Lepidodendreae
    and the ancestors of <i>Osmunda</i> and <i>Todea</i>, the two surviving
    genera of one of the most ancient families of ferns.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt as to a very close relationship
    between <i>Sigillaria</i>, <i>Lepidodendron</i>, and <i>Bothrodendron</i>. <i>Sigillaria</i>
    seems to have outlived <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Bothrodendron</i>.
    The two latter genera are recorded from Upper Devonian rocks
    in several localities, <i>Bothrodendron</i> being particularly abundant
    in the pre-Carboniferous floras of Bear Island and other parts of
    the world. A remarkable stem described by Dr White<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> as
    <i>Archaeosigillaria primaeva</i> from Upper Devonian shales of
    New York is spoken of by him as “one of the most highly
    developed representatives of a fairly distinct archaic group
    foreshadowing the later genera <i>Bothrodendron</i>, <i>Sigillaria</i>,
    <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Lepidophloios</i>.” The type-specimen, when
    first discovered, consisted of an apparently unbranched stem
    reaching a length of 5 metres. From the swollen basal part
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>Stigmaria-like rootlets spread into the surrounding shale. At
    a higher level the fissured bark shows indistinctly defined
    leaf-cushions which pass gradually upwards into cushions
    and scars arranged in closer order on regular vertical ribs.
    The surface-features in this region are practically those of a
    ribbed <i>Sigillaria</i>. Traced farther upwards the vertical ribs
    die out and cushions of the Lepidodendroid form cover the
    surface of the bark. The leaf-scars, with a supraposed ligular
    pit and two vertically elongated parichnos-scars, are said to bear
    a closer resemblance to those of <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    than to the leaf-areas of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. Nothing is known as
    to the anatomy of this stem, nor have fertile shoots been
    discovered. In the absence of more trustworthy evidence than
    is available conclusions of a phylogenetic nature must be
    accepted at their true value. It is however legitimate to
    describe <i>Archaeosigillaria primaeva</i> as one of the oldest
    examples of a lycopodiaceous plant which shows well-preserved
    external features, and these are of exceptional interest as
    indicating a combination of generic characters. This Devonian
    type lends support to the view that <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>
    are offshoots, differing from one another in comparatively
    unimportant points, from a common ancestral type.</p>

  <p>The generally accepted statement that arborescent Palaeozoic
    Lycopodiales bore their sporangia on specially modified leaves
    (sporophylls) grouped in cones which were usually produced at the
    tip of slender branches, has recently shared the fate of most rules.
    Prof. Bower in his <i>Origin of a Land Flora</i> mentions a Belgian
    specimen of <i>Pinakodendron musivum</i> Weiss from the Westphalian
    series (Middle Coal-Measures), to be described by Dr Kidston,
    which bore its sporangia “associated with the leaves of certain
    portions of the stem, without any cone-formation. The fertile
    and sterile portions are distinguished only by the presence or
    absence of sporangia<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.”</p>

  <p><i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i> can hardly be claimed as the
    direct ancestors of any existing type of Lycopodiales, but while
    exhibiting points of contact with <i>Lycopodium</i>, <i>Selaginella</i>, and
    <i>Psilotum</i> they are perhaps more closely allied to <i>Isoetes</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

  <p>Lady Isabel Browne<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>, who has recently published an excellent
    summary of the evidence on the relation of the Lepidodendreae
    to <i>Isoetes</i>, concludes her examination of the arguments by
    expressing the opinion that there is a strong probability of the
    correctness of the view that <i>Isoetes</i> may be derived “from the
    Lepidodendraceae in the widest sense of the word.” This
    decision seems to me to accord best with the facts.</p>

  <p>The further question as to the relation of these Palaeozoic
    genera to plants higher in the scale must be reserved for
    fuller consideration in another volume. An attempt will also
    be made to consider how far anatomical structure may be used
    as a guide to the conditions under which <i>Lepidodendron</i> and
    <i>Sigillaria</i> as well as other members of the Permo-Carboniferous
    floras passed their lives. The secondary xylem of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    and <i>Sigillaria</i> affords a striking example of water-conducting
    tissue of homogeneous structure comparable with the wood of
    Conifers rather than with that of Angiosperms. It was presumably
    formed, for the most part, under uniform climatic conditions:
    the absence of rings of growth points to uninterrupted
    supply to evergreen shoots exposed to no alternation of activity
    and arrested growth. Attention has already been called to the
    absence of any tissue corresponding to secondary phloem. Even in
    young shoots of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, no tissue has been found external
    to the meristematic zone agreeing in the form of its elements with
    the channels through which the elaborated food is conveyed from
    the leaves of recent plants to the regions of cell-building. That
    the ‘secretory zone’ may have served this purpose, at least in
    young stems, is not improbable. On the other hand, it is
    difficult to understand why older Lepidodendron stems show
    no indication of additions to the secretory zone. If this tissue
    served for the transport of proteids we should expect to find
    provision made for its constant renewal <i>pari passu</i> with the
    secondary growth of the xylem. The conclusion seems to me
    inevitable that the supply of building-material was otherwise
    provided for than in recent vascular plants. The physiological
    division of labour may have been less complete in the tissue-systems
    of the Palaeozoic Lycopods than in the more highly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>specialised organs of such an extinct genus as <i>Lyginodendron</i> or
    than in recent plants. Our knowledge of the anatomical structure
    of many extinct types has already reached a stage when we
    should take greater heed of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the complex
    machinery revealed by a study of petrified stems. From the
    known we proceed to interpret the unknown; but there is a
    danger of neglecting the possibilities of evolution during the
    countless ages which separate the forests of the Coal period from
    those of the present era. We may easily allow preconceived
    ideas to warp our judgment in attempting to distribute the
    manifold activities which made up the life of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    among the structural units of the plant-body.</p>

  <h4 id="Lepidocarpon">i. <i>Lepidocarpon.</i></h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1877 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> published an account of some fossil
    seeds which he referred to Brongniart’s genus <i>Cardiocarpon</i><a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>,
    a generic title for certain Gymnospermous seeds. Some
    of these he identified, on the authority of the author of the
    species, with <i>Cardiocarpon anomalum</i> Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>. Several
    years later Wild and Lomax described a new type of strobilus
    from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>. The result
    of this discovery and of the subsequent examination by Scott
    of additional material, was to establish the fact that the
    seeds described by Williamson and generally accepted as
    Gymnospermous, are in reality sporangia belonging to a
    Lycopodiaceous cone. The seeds to which Carruthers gave the
    name <i>Cardiocarpon anomalum</i> are, however, distinct from those
    described under the same name by Williamson and are those of
    a true Gymnosperm. For this seed-bearing strobilus Scott<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
    instituted the generic name <i>Lepidocarpon</i>, which he thus
    defined: “Strobili, with the characters of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>, but
    each megasporangium was inclosed, when mature, in an integument,
    growing up from the superior face of the sporophyll-pedicel.
    Integument, together with the lamina of the sporophyll,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
    completely enveloping the megasporangium, or nucellus,
    leaving only an elongated, slit-like micropyle above. A single
    functional megaspore or embryo-sac developed in each megasporangium,
    occupying almost the whole of its cavity. Megaspore
    ultimately filled by the prothallus or endosperm. Sporophyll,
    together with the integumented megasporangium and its
    contents, detached entire from the axis of the strobilus, the
    whole forming a closed, seed-like, reproductive body. Seed-like
    organ horizontally elongated, in the direction of the sporophyll-pedicel,
    to which the micropylar crevice is parallel.”</p>

  <h6><i>Lepidocarpon Lomaxi</i>, Scott. <a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>.</h6>

  <p>An immature cone of <i>L. Lomaxi</i> is practically identical with
    a <i>Lepidostrobus</i>; its sporangia are naked and only acquire their
    integuments at a later stage. A mature strobilus has a diameter
    of at least 3 cm. and is about 4 cm. in length. As in typical
    <i>Lepidostrobi</i>, the axis bears spirally disposed sporophylls, and
    each sporophyll has a long narrow pedicel approximately at
    right angles to the cone axis with its distal end expanded into
    a broad and thick lamina (<a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, B).</p>

  <p>At the distal end the pedicel has a thin marginal wing
    (<a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, C, right-hand half) continuous with the upturned
    protective lamina. To the upper face of each sporophyll is
    attached along the whole length as far as the ligule, a single
    large sporangium; on each side of the base of the sporangium
    the sporophyll forms a supporting cushion. The relation of
    the sporangium to the ligule, <i>l</i>, is shown in <a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, B, and in
    the tangential section, C, which illustrates the triangular form
    of the sporangium near its distal end.</p>

  <p>In mature cones, the sporangia assumed the form of seeds,
    the change being due to the growth of an investing integument
    from the upper face of the sporophylls on each side of the
    sporangia. <a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>, A, illustrates the form of a sporangium
    as shown in tangential sections; the vascular bundle is seen
    below the base of the sporangium and the gaps right and left of
    it probably mark the position of parichnos strands. On each
    side of the sporangium, <i>b</i>, a fairly thick wall of tissue has grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
    up from the sporophyll, forming an integument which overtops
    the apical ridge of the sporangium, leaving a narrow micropyle in
    the form of a long crevice (<i>m</i>, <a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, B). At the proximal end
    of the sporangium the integument forms an enclosing wall; at
    the distal end it abuts on and is continuous with the upturned
    end of the sporophyll. It is clearly established by Scott that the
    tissue which invests the sporangia is not the upturned margins
    of the sporophyll, but a new formation fully entitled to the
    designation integument. It is noteworthy that the integument is
    not developed until a late stage in the ontogeny of the strobilus;
    it is not formed until after the production of the prothallus<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>The diagrammatic sketch, <a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, B, shows the relation of the
    integument to the sporophyll and sporangium, the outline of
    the latter being indicated by a broken line. The columnar wall
    of the sporangium (<a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>, A, <i>b</i>) forms a closed beak within
    the micropylar crevice, and in the interior of the sporangial
    cavity the slightly shrivelled membrane, <i>a</i>, represents the single
    megaspore; traces of the aborted sister-cells of the megaspore are
    occasionally met with. Scott describes a specimen in which the
    megaspore is filled with tissue agreeing in appearance with the
    prothallus in a megaspore of <i>Isoetes</i> or <i>Selaginella</i>; no undoubted
    archegonia or female organs have been discovered, nor
    has any spore been found containing an embryo.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The axis of <i>L. Lomaxi</i> has a medullated stele constructed
    on the same plan as that of some species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and
    <i>Lepidostrobus</i>; the vascular bundles supplying the sporophylls
    pass obliquely upwards and outwards from the stele, <i>St</i>, fig.
    218, B, and bend slightly downward just before entering the
    pedicel of a sporophyll.</p>

  <p>Dr Scott has also described a strobilus containing microsporangia
    partially enclosed by a rudimentary integument. It
    is, however, of considerable interest to find a partial development
    in the case of a male flower of an integumentary outgrowth,
    which it would seem could only be of real functional importance
    in the female shoot.</p>

  <p>It is important to notice that specimens of a second species
    of <i>Lepidocarpon</i>, <i>L. Wildianum</i>, are recorded from Lower
    Carboniferous beds of Scotland, a fact which points to a considerable
    antiquity for this seed-bearing Lycopodiaceous type<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>.</p>

  <p>The most important question to consider in regard to
    <i>Lepidocarpon</i> is—are we justified in applying to the integumented
    sporangia the term seed? The megaspore was not
    set free as it is in recent Pteridophytes, such as <i>Azolla</i> and
    other genera with which <i>Lepidocarpon</i> may be compared; it
    was on the other hand retained in the sporangium, as may
    sometimes happen even in recent species of <i>Selaginella</i> (cf.
    <a href="#fig131">fig. 131</a>, D). Moreover, the megaspore is characterised by a thin
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>enclosing membrane in contrast to the thick coat of a spore
    which is destined to be shed. The peculiar slit-like form of
    the micropyle is a distinguishing feature, but this may be
    readily explained as a convenient form in the case of a radially
    elongated sporangium. The absence of an embryo, though a
    distinguishing feature of <i>Lepidocarpon</i>, cannot be held to be
    a serious obstacle to the use of the term seed; in recent Cycads
    the embryo, as Scott points out, may not begin to develope
    until the seed has been shed. It is possible that the seeds of
    <i>Lepidocarpon</i> were not pollinated on the parent plant.</p>

  <p>The lesson which this extinct type teaches, is that certain
    Lycopodiaceous plants of the Palaeozoic era had reached an
    important stage in the evolution of a seed. The morphological
    essentials of true seeds had been acquired; but we do not know
    the biological conditions under which pollination and fertilisation
    were effected. Another point of considerable interest is
    the value of this discovery as an argument in favour of the
    view that some Gymnosperms are derived from Lycopod ancestors.
    Leaving the general question until later, it may
    at any rate be stated that in <i>Lepidocarpon</i> we have a demonstration
    of the fact that the Lycopodiales were not always
    distinguished from Gymnosperms by the absence of seeds.
    There are certain features in <i>Lepidocarpon</i> shared by the seeds
    of Araucarieae<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> which may well mean something more than
    mere parallel development in two distinct phyla of the plant-kingdom<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Miadesmia">ii. <i>Miadesmia.</i></h4>

  <p>In 1894 Prof. Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> published an account of certain
    fragments of petrified leaves and twigs of a small herbaceous
    Lycopodiaceous plant, under the name <i>Miadesmia membranacea</i>,
    which he discovered in English material in association with
    <i>Lepidodendron Harcourtii</i>. Subsequently Scott recognised
    the megasporophylls of the same plant, and microsporophylls
    have also been discovered. The most complete account of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span><i>Miadesmia</i> so far published we owe to Dr Benson<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>, whose
    description is based on specimens from several sources.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The slender stem, characterised by unequal dichotomy, has
    a single protostele composed of scalariform tracheids with 3–6
    peripheral protoxylem groups. A zone of delicate tissue surrounds
    the xylem; this is described as phloem, but it is not
    clear whether the designation is based on histological characters
    or primarily on its position. The cortex consists of an inner
    lacunar tissue and an outer region limited by a small-celled
    superficial layer sharply contrasted with the underlying layers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>of larger cells. The stem of <i>Miadesmia</i> is not uncommon in
    sections of the Lancashire calcareous nodules, and may be
    recognised by the delicate crushed tissue of which it mainly
    consists and by large hypodermal parenchyma. The spirally
    disposed leaves bear a conspicuous and relatively large ligule,
    3 mm. long, in a deep pit (<a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>, B and C) roofed over by a
    few layers of tissue corresponding to the velum in <i>Isoetes</i>
    (cf. <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, E, <i>v</i>). The fairly thick central region of the lamina
    is expanded laterally into thin wings, which in the living
    state probably bore delicate hairs. These delicate leaves,
    apparently without stomata, were attached to the stem at an
    acute angle, and Miss Benson suggests that their form and
    arrangement may have enabled them to hold water by surface-tension.
    As seen in <a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>, B, C, which represents part of
    a transverse section near the leaf-base, the ligule is a very
    characteristic feature, and the size of the single vein is in
    keeping with the almost filmy nature of the lamina.</p>

  <p>In addition to the sections in British collections, I have
    been enabled by the kindness of Prof. Bertrand to see photomicrographs
    of the sections on which he founded the genus.
    One of these sections, transverse to the stem and leaves,
    illustrates in a striking manner the relatively large size of
    the leaves and ligules in proportion to the delicate axis of the
    shoot.</p>

  <p>The megasporangiate cone has an axis which agrees in its
    structure with that of the vegetative stem and bears several
    megasporophylls approximately at right-angles. As in the
    foliage leaves, the ligule is prominent and large, and lies in a
    groove which contains also the megasporangium; both ligule, <i>l</i>,
    and sporangium, <i>s</i>, as seen in the transverse section represented
    in <a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>, D, are covered by an integument or velum which
    arises in the proximal part of the leaf and leaves a circular
    micropylar opening at the beak-like apex of the sporangium.
    The circular micropyle is surrounded by numerous hairs borne
    on the integument and which presumably played the part of a
    feathery stigma. A single megaspore with a thin membrane,
    <i>m</i>, abuts on the fairly strong sporangial wall, <i>s</i>; in some cases
    the sporangium and megaspore walls may be indistinguishable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
    a feature suggesting comparison with seed-structure. Some
    megaspores have been found filled with a prothallus. The
    longitudinal section shown in <a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>, A, illustrates the characteristic
    horizontal position of the megasporophyll, as also the
    relation of the ligule, <i>l</i>, to the sporophyll with its single vascular
    bundle, and to the hairy integument, which overarches both
    sporangium and ligule; the line <i>m</i> shows the position of the
    megaspore-membrane, detached from the sporangial wall on the
    upper side but in contact with it below. The microsporophyll
    shown in 219, E, was originally referred to <i>Miadesmia</i> but has
    since been recognised by Watson<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> as that of a <i>Bothrostrobus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Miadesmia</i> affords an example of a Palaeozoic plant comparable
    with <i>Isoetes</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>; it agrees also with
    <i>Lepidocarpon</i> in possessing true seeds, and with Watson’s
    <i>Bothrodendron</i> cone in the shape of the sporangia, which are
    more like those of <i>Selaginella</i> than the radially elongated
    sporangia of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>. <i>Miadesmia</i> agrees with <i>Selaginella</i>,
    e.g. <i>S. spinosa</i>, in its stelar structure, in the form of the
    sporangia, and in the presence of a ligule. It is distinguished
    by having only one instead of four megaspores in a sporangium,
    in the possession of an integument which formed a close investment
    to the spore and served as a stigma (comparable with
    the stigma-like integument of the male flower of <i>Welwitschia</i>),
    and in the shedding of the megasporophylls, which have been
    aptly compared with winged seeds.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">LEPIDOCARPON</div>

  <p>On the ground of their general anatomical features <i>Lepidocarpon</i>
    and <i>Miadesmia</i> are clearly entitled to be included among
    extinct representatives of the Pteridophyta. These plants had,
    however, crossed what it has been customary to regard as the
    boundary between Pteridophytes and Phanerogams: they
    possessed megasporangia with the attributes of seeds. It has
    been suggested by Lester Ward<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> that Pteridophytic seed-bearing
    plants shall be recognised as a distinct phylum for which he
    proposes the name Pteridospermaphyta, a designation implying
    exclusion from the Spermatophyta as usually understood. For
    seed-bearing Lycopodiaceous genera he suggests the name
    Lepidospermae. As knowledge of the Palaeozoic seed-plants
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>increases revision of existing classifications and group names
    will become necessary, but as yet we are hardly in a position to
    draw up a satisfactory scheme of grouping; we know little of
    <i>Lepidocarpon</i> as a whole and it would be premature to commit
    ourselves, even provisionally, to a classification which is based
    on such meagre evidence as we possess. Moreover the value to
    be attached to the seed-habit as a basis of classification can
    hardly be estimated until fuller information is obtained.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FILICALES.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">This</span> division of the Pteridophyta includes both the true
    ferns (Filicineae) and the less familiar water-ferns or Hydropterideae.
    The almost complete absence of satisfactory evidence
    in regard to the geological history of the latter renders this
    group of secondary importance from a palaeobotanical standpoint,
    but, on the other hand, we possess a wealth of material
    bearing on the past history and relative antiquity of the true
    ferns.</p>

  <p>The study of extinct types has so far rendered no substantial
    help towards bridging the wide gap between the
    Filicales and the lower plants. As Mr Tansley<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> says in his
    admirable lectures on <i>The Evolution of the Filicinean Vascular
    System</i>, “The biggest gap in the plant kingdom at the present
    time is undoubtedly that which separates the Pteridophytes
    from the plants definitely below them in organisation, and
    directly we try to step behind the ferns we tumble into this
    abyss.” Resemblances long ago recognised between certain
    ferns and the cycads, a section of the Gymnosperms, were
    regarded by a few botanists as indications of blood-relationship,
    and the results of recent researches into the morphological
    characters of extinct Palaeozoic types are generally held to
    confirm these surmises. Prof. Chodat<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> of Geneva has recently
    challenged the validity of the arguments on which the
    affinity of cycads and ferns has been accepted by the great
    majority of botanists. Whether or not his criticisms stand the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>test of unbiassed examination, they must at least lead us
    to substitute a critical consideration of the facts for a mere
    repetition of conclusions which appeal to our imagination.
    Despite Prof. Chodat’s warning, we may still quote with confidence
    a phrase used in another connexion—ferns “are links
    in a chain and branches on the tree of life, with their roots in
    a past inconceivably remote<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PTERIDOSPERMS</div>

  <p>Transitional forms which are regarded as pointing to a
    common origin for ferns and cycads are known in abundance;
    other types have also been discovered which lead some authors
    to go so far as to derive the whole of the seed-bearing plants
    from an ancestry the descendants of which are represented by
    existing ferns. While hesitating to allow the ferns or fern-like
    plants the peculiar position of universal ancestors, we must
    admit that there is no group of plants with a history of greater
    importance from an evolutionary standpoint than that with
    which we are now concerned.</p>

  <p>There are, however, some difficulties to face in attempting
    to decipher the history of the Filicineae as recorded in the
    earth’s crust. Few fossil plants are so familiar as the well-preserved
    carbonaceous impressions of compound leaves on the
    shales of our Coal-Measures, which were referred by older authors
    to recent genera and species of ferns and accepted by later
    writers as undoubted examples of Palaeozoic ferns. The common
    belief in the dominance of ferns in Palaeozoic floras is reflected
    in the novelist’s description of the Carboniferous period, “when
    the forms of plants were few and often of the fern kind<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.” We
    now know that very many of these Carboniferous leaves belonged
    to plants differing widely in morphological characters
    from the modern genera to which they exhibit so deceptive
    a resemblance. These pseudo-ferns, recently christened Pteridosperms
    or seed-bearing fern-like plants, are dealt with in a
    later chapter. The discovery of this extinct group has added
    enormously to our knowledge of plant-evolution and at the
    same time has rendered much more difficult the task of unravelling
    the past history of the true ferns. As soon as it was
    demonstrated that many familiar Palaeozoic “ferns” are not
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>ferns, some authors went far towards concluding that however
    close might be the agreement between fossil and recent leaves
    suspicion of close relationship must be set aside. Like the
    earlier writers who described fossils as <i>lusus naturae</i> fashioned
    by devilish agency to deceive too credulous man, the discovery
    of seed-bearing plants with the foliage of ferns threatened to
    disturb the mental balance of palaeobotanists. The fact is,
    we cannot in some cases determine from leaf-form alone whether
    or not a fossil is a true fern; we may, as Professor Bower<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
    suggests, regard all fern-like fossils as ferns until they are
    proved to be Pteridosperms, or in a spirit of scientific scepticism,
    we may at once admit that many Palaeozoic fern-like
    leaves must await further evidence before their true position
    can be determined. It is impossible, as Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> says, in the
    present state of our knowledge to range fern-like Palaeozoic
    plants in two groups, one referred to Filicineae and the other
    to the Pteridosperms.</p>

  <p>The following classification of the Filicales is based on
    that adopted by Prof. Engler in the latest edition of his
    <i>Syllabus</i><a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> and on the results of Bower’s<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> excellent work on the
    spore-bearing members of recent ferns.</p>

  <p>The members of the Filicales are characterised by the same
    well-marked physiological division of labour in their vegetative
    parts as are the Lycopods; the plant is the asexual generation
    (sporophyte), while the sexual generation (gametophyte) is
    small and inconspicuous, either an independent green prothallus
    or a tissue more or less completely enclosed in the spore. The
    large size of the leaves, which in the young state are usually
    coiled like a crozier (<a href="#fig220">fig. 220</a>, A), is a striking characteristic of
    the ferns; they are megaphyllous in contrast to the microphylly
    of the Lycopods.</p>

  <p>In these homosporous and heterosporous plants the sporangia
    are developed from single epidermal cells.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Eufilicineae.</i> The sporangia bear spores of one kind
    only; the wall of a sporangium consists of one layer of cells. In
    the great majority of cases the sporangia are characterised by
    the possession of a conspicuous row of thick-walled brown
    cells, the annulus<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>, which serves as a mechanism for dehiscence
    and spore-dispersal. The fertile leaves, identical in form with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>the sterile, or more or less sharply contrasted, usually bear the
    sporangia on the under surface of the lamina in definite groups
    or sori, and not on the upper surface or grouped in strobili as
    in the Lycopodiales. The stem is dorsiventral or radial in
    structure, creeping or erect, frequently clothed with chaffy
    scales (ramenta) and less often with multicellular hairs. The
    sexual generation is represented by a small green prothallus
    which lives for a short period only and dies after nursing the
    fern-plant through its earliest stages.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Hydropterideae.</i> Heterosporous water-ferns differing
    considerably in habit from the true ferns. Each megasporangium
    contains a single megaspore and several microspores are
    produced in each microsporangium. The gametophyte is represented
    by tissue more or less enclosed in the spore. [Genera

  <h4 id="Eufilicineae">Eufilicineae.</h4>

  <p>The classification of the true ferns in
    common use is based almost exclusively on the structure of the
    sporangium, the form and position of the sori, and on the
    presence or absence of an indusium (the tissue which in some
    ferns partially or completely covers each sorus). In recent
    years there has been considerable activity in the investigation
    of fern anatomy with a view to elucidating the natural relationship
    between recent families or genera. The results of these
    researches are on the whole consistent with the scheme and
    grouping adopted in the <i>Synopsis Filicum</i> of Hooker and Baker
    and in general harmony with the main conclusions arrived at
    by Bower from an intensive study of the development of fern
    sporangia. The following classification is based on that of
    Bower who takes as a basis (i) the relative time of appearance
    of the sporangia in a single sorus, (ii) the structure of the
    sporangia and their orientation relative to the whole sorus,
    (iii) the productiveness of sporangia (spore-output).</p>

    represented by a group of thicker-walled cells a short distance
    below the apex (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, C). This family stands apart among
    the ferns; in some respects, e.g. in the more robust sporangia
    occasionally forming synangia, and in the presence of stipular
    wings, it forms a transitional series between the Leptosporangiate
    and Eusporangiate ferns. The only European species of <i>Osmunda</i>,

    in North and South America, in the Far East, the Malay

  <p><i>Gleichenia</i> is represented by several species in the tropics
    and extends to south temperate and Antarctic latitudes. The
    species <i>G. dichotoma</i> (= <i>G. linearis</i>) is one of the more successful
    tropical ferns, while <i>G. moniliformis</i> (by some authors recognised
    as a distinct genus, <i>Stromatopteris</i>) is peculiar to New
    Caledonia. The monotypic genus <i>Platyzoma</i> is a xerophilous
    Australian fern. The Gleicheniaceae are unrepresented in
    existing north temperate floras.</p>

  <h4 id="Matonineae">Matonineae. <span class="nobold">(<i>Matonia.</i>)</span></h4>

  <p>The genus <i>Matonia</i>, placed in the Cyatheaceae by Sir
    William Hooker and compared by other authors also with
    the Gleicheniaceae, is now included in a special family. The
    sori are circular and consist of 5–11 large sporangia (<a href="#fig224">fig. 224</a>,
    E, G) sessile on a central columnar receptacle which spreads
    out into an umbrella-like indusium (D, <i>i</i>) with its incurved
    margin tucked in below the ring of sporangia. The indusium
    is detached when the sporangia are ripe. The annulus
    is oblique and incomplete and often slightly sinuous; it
    agrees in the main with that of <i>Gleichenia</i>. The species
    <i>Matonia pectinata</i> is characterised by dichotomously branched
    fronds (figs. <a href="#fig227">227</a>, <a href="#fig228">228</a>) with long and slender petioles; the
    pinnae bear linear pinnules with forked lateral veins and
    occasional lateral anastomoses (<a href="#fig224">fig. 224</a>, F). The only other
    living representative is <i>M. sarmentosa</i>, discovered by Mr
    Charles Hose at Niah, Sarawak<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>: this species has long
    pendulous leaves apparently very different from those of
    <i>M. pectinata</i>, but the branching of the frond may be regarded as
    a modification of a primitive form of dichotomy<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. A small bud
    occurs in the angle between the forked linear segments and the
    rachis, as in some species of <i>Gleichenia</i><a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. <i>Matonia</i> is confined to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>the Malay region: <i>M. pectinata</i> grows in Western Borneo and in
    various localities in the Malay peninsula, while <i>M. sarmentosa</i>,
    has been found in one locality only; the latter species has
    recently been transferred to a new genus <i>Phanerosorus</i>, but
    in view of the practical identity in anatomical structure and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>

    characterised by an obliquely transverse annulus (<a href="#fig224">fig. 224</a>, C). A
    cup-like indusium surrounds the lower portion of the receptacle
    which is two-lipped in <i>Trichomanes</i> and entire in <i>Hymenophyllum</i>
    (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, C, D). These two filmy ferns have a wide
    distribution both in tropical and extra-tropical regions; they
    are represented in the British Isles by <i>Hymenophyllum tunbrigense</i>,
    <i>H. Wilsoni</i>, and <i>Trichomanes radicans</i>.</p>

  <p>The sporangia occur in indusiate or naked sori and have an
    obliquely vertical and incomplete annulus (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, E). In the
    great majority of cases the fronds are large and highly compound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
    but <i>Cyathea sinuata</i> Hook, a rare Ceylon species, bears
    simple narrow linear leaves. This family includes, with few
    exceptions, all the tree ferns<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>. The sori of <i>Dicksonia</i> are
    enclosed in a two-valved indusium (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, F. G); in the
    species represented in <a href="#fig230">fig. 230</a> the fertile segments, which
    terminate in cup-like indusia, are characterised by the absence of
    a lamina and closely resemble those of <i>Thyrsopteris</i> (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, A).
    In <i>Cyathea</i> the indusium has the form of a cup which is at first
    closed and afterwards opens at the apex (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, B); in <i>Hemitelia</i>
    the indusium is much reduced and in <i>Alsophila</i> the sori
    are naked. <i>Thyrsopteris</i> is characterised by the reduced fertile
    pinnules bearing stalked sori in deep cups (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, A). The
    appearance of this fern “is very remarkable, for the cup-shaped
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>sori hang down from the fronds in masses, looking just like
    masses of millet seed<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.” The sporangia are described by Bower<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>
    as large and of rather peculiar form. As seen in <a href="#fig224">fig. 224</a>, H, the
    annulus is continuous; it forms a twisted loop of cells which
    vary in shape and in the thickness of the walls. The Cyatheaceae
    are for the most part tropical ferns with a wide geographical
    range, usually in moist regions; they are, however, able to
    flourish under widely different temperature conditions. In
    Tasmania, as Diels<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> points out, tree ferns may occasionally be
    seen laden with snow, and on the west coast of New Zealand
    they overhang the edge of a glacier<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. The monotypic genus
    <i>Thyrsopteris</i> is confined to Juan Fernandez. The Cyatheaceae
    no longer exist in Europe.</p>

  <p>This sub-tribe, instituted by Prantl, has been revived by
    Bower on the ground that the sori present features intermediate
    between those of Cyatheaceae and the Polypodiaceous
    genus <i>Davallia</i>. The sporangia have a slightly oblique
    annulus.</p>

  <h4 id="Polypodiaceae1">Polypodiaceae.</h4>

  <p>This section of the Leptosporangiate ferns, including several
    sub-tribes, comprises the great majority of recent genera. The
    sporangia form naked or indusiate sori and have a vertical incomplete
    annulus. In <i>Plagiogyria</i><a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> the oblique annulus and
    soral features suggest comparison with the Cyatheaceae. A
    more intimate acquaintance with Polypodiaceous ferns will
    undoubtedly demonstrate the existence of other generalised
    types<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of the identification of fossil ferns
    it is important to bear in mind the very close resemblance
    presented by some Polypodiaceous species, e.g. species of
    <i>Davallia</i> (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, C), to Cyatheaceous ferns (cf. <a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, D).</p>

    composed of numerous cells differing in their greater breadth
    and smaller depth from those of a typical annulus. Exannulate
    sporangia have been described, while others occur showing
    different stages between a rudimentary and a complete ring.

  <h4>Dipteridinae. <span class="nobold">(<i>Dipteris.</i>)</span></h4>

  <p>The genus <i>Dipteris</i>, formerly included in the Polypodiaceae,
    has been assigned to a separate family partly on account of the
    slight obliquity of the vertical annulus (<a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>, G) and on other
    grounds<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>. The four species <i>Dipteris conjugata</i>, <i>D. Wallichii</i>,
    <i>D. Lobbiana</i> (= <i>D. bifurcata</i>), and D. <i>quinquefurcata</i> (<a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>)
    are characterised by a creeping rhizome bearing fronds reaching
    a length of 50 cm.; in <i>D. conjugata</i> and <i>D. Wallichii</i> the lamina
    is divided by a median sinus into two symmetrical halves, while
    in other species the leaf is dissected into narrow linear segments.
    The main dichotomously branched ribs are connected by lateral
    branches and these by tertiary veins, the delicate branches of
    which end freely within the square or polygonal areolae (<a href="#fig231">fig.
    231</a>, A′, E). The naked sori are composed of numerous sporangia
    and filamentous hairs: while in some species the soral development
    conforms to that characteristic of the Mixtae, it has been
    shown that in one species, <i>D. Lobbiana</i> (= <i>D. bifurcata</i><a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>), the
    sporangia develope simultaneously as in the Simplices. <i>Dipteris</i>
    occurs in company with <i>Matonia</i> on Mt Ophir and elsewhere in
    the Malay peninsula; it extends to the Philippines, Samoa,
    New Caledonia, China, New Guinea, and the subtropical regions
    of Northern India.</p>

  <p>The impossibility of drawing a hard and fast line between
    the divisions adopted in any system of classification is well
    illustrated by the ferns. In the main, the three-fold grouping
    suggested by Bower is probably consistent with the order of
    evolution of the true ferns. The Polypodiaceae, which are now
    the dominant group, are in all probability of comparatively
    recent origin, while the Gradatae and Simplices represent smaller
    subdivisions with representatives in remote geological epochs.
    The genera <i>Loxsoma</i>, <i>Matonia</i> and <i>Dipteris</i> afford examples of
    ferns exhibiting points of contact with more than one of Bower’s
    subdivisions: they are generalised types which, like many relics
    of the past, are now characterised by a restricted geographical
    range.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that while certain vegetative features may
    in some cases be cited as family-characters, such features are
    not usually of much value from a taxonomic point of view.
    While the typical tree ferns are practically all members of the
    Cyatheaceae, a few members of other families, e.g. <i>Todea barbara</i>
    (Osmundaceae) and the monotypic Indian genus <i>Brainea</i> (Polypodiaceae),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
    form erect stems several feet in height; but these
    differ in appearance from the Palm-like type of the Cyatheaceous
    tree ferns. On the other hand, the thin, almost transparent,
    leaf of <i>Hymenophyllum tunbridgense</i> and other filmy ferns is
    a character shared by several species of <i>Todea</i>, <i>Asplenium resectum</i>,
    and <i>Danaea trichomanoides</i> (Marattiaceae); the filmy
    habit is essentially a biological adaptation.</p>

  <p>The form of frond represented by certain species of
    <i>Gleichenia</i>, characterised by a regular dichotomy of the axis and
    by the occurrence of arrested buds, is on the whole a trustworthy
    character, though <i>Davallia aculeata</i> (bearing spines on its rachis)
    (<a href="#fig232">fig. 232</a>) and <i>Matonia sarmentosa</i> have fronds with a similar
    mode of branching and also bear arrested radius-buds. A limited
    acquaintance with ferns as a whole often leads us to regard a
    certain form of leaf as characteristic of a particular species, but
    more extended enquiry usually exposes the fallacy of relying
    upon so capricious a feature. The form of leaf illustrated by
    <i>Trichomanes reniforme</i> is met with also in <i>Gymnogramme reniformis</i>
    and is fairly closely matched by the leaf of <i>Scolopendrium
    nigripes</i>. The fronds of <i>Matonia pectinata</i> (figs. <a href="#fig227">227</a>, <a href="#fig228">228</a>) bear a
    close resemblance to those of <i>Gleichenia Cunninghami</i>, <i>Adiantum
    pedatum</i>, and <i>Cheiropteris palmatopedata</i><a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Distribution_of_ferns">The habit, leaf-form, and distribution of Ferns.</h4>

  <p>The full accounts of the structure and life-history of the
    common Male Fern, given by Scott in his <i>Structural Botany</i> and
    by Bower in the <i>Origin of a Land Flora</i>, render superfluous
    more than a brief reference to certain general considerations in
    so far as they may facilitate a study of fossil types.</p>

  <p>In size Ferns have a wide range: at the one extreme we
    have the filmy fern <i>Trichomanes Goebelianum</i><a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>, growing on tree
    stems in Venezuela, with leaves 2·5 to 3 mm. in diameter, and
    at the other the tree ferns with tall columnar stems reaching a
    height of 40 to 50 feet and terminating in a crown of fronds
    with a spread of several feet. A common form of stem is
    represented by the subterranean or creeping rhizome covered
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>with ramental scales or hairs: the remains of old leaves may
    persist as ragged stumps, or, as in <i>Oleandra</i>, <i>Polypodium vulgare</i>
    and several other species, the leaf may be cut off by the formation
    of an absciss-layer<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> leaving a clean-cut peg projecting
    from the stem. As a rule the branches bear no relation to the
    leaves and are often given off from the lower part of a petiole,
    but in a few cases, e.g. in the <i>Hymenophyllaceae</i>, it is noteworthy
    that true axillary branching is the rule<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. In the typical tree-fern
    the surface resembles that of a Cycadean trunk covered
    with persistent leaf-bases and a thick mass of roots. Among
    epiphytic ferns highly modified stems are occasionally met with,
    as in the Malayan species <i>Polypodium</i> (<i>Lecanopteris</i>) <i>carnosum</i>
    and <i>P. sinuosum</i><a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>.</p>

  <p>The leaves of ferns are among the most protean of all plant
    organs; as Darwin wrote, “the variability of ferns passes all
    bounds<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.” The highly compound tri- or quadripinnate leaves
    of such species as <i>Pteris aquilina</i>, <i>Davallia</i> and other genera
    stand for the central type of fern frond; others exhibit a well-marked
    dichotomy, e.g. <i>Lygodium</i>, <i>Gleichenia</i>, <i>Matonia</i>, etc., a
    habit in all probability associated with the older rather than
    with the more modern products of fern evolution. Before
    attempting to determine specifically fossil fern fronds, it is
    important to familiarise ourselves with the range of variability
    among existing species and more especially in leaves of the
    same plant. A striking example of heteromorphy is illustrated
    in <a href="#fig233">fig. 233</a>. Reinecke<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> has figured a plant of <i>Asplenium multilineatum</i>
    in which the segments of the compound fronds assume
    various forms. In <i>Teratophyllum aculeatum var. inermis</i> Mett.,
    a tropical climbing fern believed by Karsten<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> to be identical
    with <i>Acrostichum</i> (<i>Lomariopsis</i>) <i>sorbifolium</i>,—an identification
    which Goebel<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> questions,—the fronds which stand free of the
    stem supporting the climber differ considerably from the
    translucent and much more delicate filmy leaves pressed against
    the supporting tree. From this fern alone Fée is said to have
    created 17 distinct species. In this, as in many other cases,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>differences in leaf-form are the expression of a physiological
    division of labour connected with an epiphytic existence. Some
    tropical species of <i>Polypodium</i> (sect. <i>Drynaria</i>), e.g. <i>P. quercifolium</i>
    (<a href="#fig234">fig. 234</a> and <a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>, D), produce two distinct types of
    leaf, the large green fronds, concerned with the assimilation of
    carbon and spore-production, being in sharp contrast to the small
    slightly lobed brown leaves which act as stiff brackets (fig.
    234, M) for collecting humus from which the roots absorb raw
    material. Similarly in <i>Platycerium</i> the orbicular mantle-leaves
    differ widely from the long pendulous or erect fronds fashioned
    like the spreading antlers of an elk. In <i>Hemitelia capensis</i>, a
    South African Cyatheaceous species, the basal pinnae assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
    the form of finely divided leaves identified by earlier collectors as
    those of a parasitic <i>Trichomanes</i> (<a href="#fig235">fig. 235</a>). In a letter written
    by W. H. Harvey in 1837 accompanying the specimen shown
    in <a href="#fig235">fig. 235</a>, he says, “Apropos of <i>Hemitelia</i>, be it known abroad
    that supposed parasitical <i>Trichomanes</i> ... is not a parasite, but
    a part of the frond of <i>Hemitelia</i>.” The delicate reduced pinnae
    remain on the stem and form a cluster at the base of the
    fronds<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>.</p>

  <p>In many species the sporophylls are distinguished from the
    sterile fronds by segments with little or no chlorophyllous tissue,
    as in <i>Onoclea struthiopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> in which, each year, the plant produces
    a funnel-shaped group of sterile leaves followed later in
    the season by a cluster of sporophylls; or, as in many other
    genera, the fertile leaves are distinguished also by longer petioles
    and thus serve as more efficient agents of spore-dissemination.
    In <i>Ceratopteris</i> the narrow segments of the taller fertile leaves
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>are in striking contrast to the broader pinnules of the submerged
    foliage leaves. Leaf-form is in many cases obviously
    the expression of environment; the xerophilous fern <i>Jamesonia</i><a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>
    from the treeless paramos of the Andes<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> is characterised by
    its minute leaflets with strong revolute margins and a thick felt
    of hairs on the lower surface; in others, xerophilous features take
    the form of a covering of overlapping scales (<i>Ceterach</i>), or a
    development of water-tissue as in the fleshy leaves of the
    Himalayan fern <i>Drymoglossum carnosum</i>. In the Bracken fern
    Boodle<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> has shown how the fronds may be classed as shade and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>sun leaves; the former are spreading and softer, while the latter
    are relatively smaller and of harder texture (<a href="#fig236a">fig. 236</a>, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>).
    Even in one leaf six feet high, growing through a dense bush
    of gorse and bramble, the lower part was found to have the
    features of a shade leaf, while the uppermost exposed pinnae
    were xerophilous.</p>

  <p>The resemblance between some of the filmy Hymenophyllaceae<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
    and thalloid Liverworts<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> is worthy of mention as one of
    the many possible pitfalls to be avoided by the palaeobotanical
    student. The long linear fronds of such genera as <i>Vittaria</i> and
    <i>Monogramme</i> might well be identified in a fossil state as the
    leaves of a grass-like Monocotyledon, or compared with the
    foliage of <i>Isoetes</i> or <i>Pilularia</i>. The resemblance of some fern
    leaves with reticulate venation to those of Dicotyledons has led
    astray experienced palaeobotanists; it is not only the anastomosing
    venation in the leaves of several ferns that simulates
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>dicotyledonous foliage, but the compound leaves of many dicotyledons,
    e.g. <i>Paullinia thalictrifolia</i> (Sapindaceae) and species

  <p>The dichotomously lobed lamina of some Schizaeas, e.g.
    <i>S. dichotoma</i> and <i>S. elegans</i> (<a href="#fig222">fig. 222</a>), bears a close resemblance
    to the leaves of <i>Baiera</i> or <i>Ginkgo</i><a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>. The original description by
    Kunze<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> of the South African Cycad <i>Stangeria paradoxa</i> as a
    Polypodiaceous fern illustrates the difficulty, or indeed impossibility,
    of distinguishing between a sterile simply pinnate fern
    frond and the foliage of some Cycads. The deeply divided
    segments of <i>Cycas Micholitzii</i><a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> simulate the dichotomously
    branched pinnae of <i>Lygodium dichotomum</i>, and the leaves of
    <i>Aneimia rotundifolia</i> (<a href="#fig223">fig. 223</a>) and other species are almost
    identical in form with the Jurassic species <i>Otozamites Beani</i>,
    a member of the Cycadophyta.</p>

  <p>There are certain facts in regard to the geographical distribution
    of ferns to which attention should be directed. Mr
    Baker in his paper on fern distribution writes: “With the
    precision of an hygrometer, an increase in the fern-vegetation
    marks the wooded humid regions<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>.” If in a collection of fossil
    plants we find a preponderance of ferns we are tempted to
    assume the existence of such conditions as are favourable to the
    luxuriant development of ferns at the present day. On the
    other hand, we must bear in mind the wonderful plasticity of
    many recent species and the fact that xerophilous ferns are by
    no means unknown in present-day floras.</p>

  <p>Ferns are admirably adapted to rapid dispersal over comparatively
    wide areas. Bower<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> estimates that in one season
    a Male Fern may produce about 5,000,000 spores: with
    this enormous spore-output are coupled a thoroughly efficient
    mechanism for scattering the germs and an unusual facility
    for wind-dispersal. When Treub<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> visited the devastated and
    sterilised wreck of the Island of Krakatau in 1886, three years
    after the volcanic outburst, he found that twelve ferns had
    already established themselves; the spores had probably been
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>carried by the wind at least 25 to 30 miles. It is not surprising,
    therefore, to find that many ferns have an almost world-wide
    distribution; and, it may be added, in view of their efficient
    means of dispersal, wide range by no means implies great
    antiquity. Prof. Campbell<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> has recently called attention to the
    significance of the wide distribution of Hepaticae in its bearing on
    their antiquity; the spores are incapable of retaining vitality for
    more than a short period, and it is argued that a world-wide
    distribution can have been acquired only after an enormous
    lapse of time. If we apply this reasoning to the Osmundaceae
    among ferns, it may be legitimate to assume that their short-lived
    green spores render them much less efficient colonisers
    than the great majority of ferns; if this is granted, the wide
    distribution of Osmundaceous ferns in the Mesozoic era carries
    their history back to a still more remote past, a conclusion
    which receives support from the records of the rocks.</p>

  <p>The Bracken fern which we regard as characteristically
    British is a cosmopolitan type; it was found by Treub among
    the pioneers of the New Flora of Krakatau; in British Central
    Africa, it greets one at every turn “like a messenger from the
    homeland<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>”; it grows on the Swiss Alps, on the mountains of
    Abyssinia, in Tasmania, and on the slopes of the Himalayas.
    The two genera <i>Matonia</i> (<a href="#fig228">fig. 228</a>) and <i>Dipteris</i>, which grow
    side by side on Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula, are examples
    of restricted geographical range and carry us back to the Jurassic
    period when closely allied types flourished abundantly in northern
    latitudes. Similarly <i>Thyrsopteris elegans</i>, confined to Juan
    Fernandez, exhibits a remarkable likeness to Jurassic species
    from England and the Arctic regions.</p>

  <p>The proportion of ferns to flowering plants in recent floras is
    a question of some interest from a palaeobotanical point of view;
    but we must bear in mind the fact that the evolution of
    angiosperms, effected at a late stage in the history of the earth,
    seriously disturbed the balance of power among competitors for
    earth and air. The abundance of ferns in a particular region is,
    however, an unsafe guide to geographical or climatic conditions.
    Many ferns are essentially social plants; the wide stretches of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>moorland carpeted with <i>Pteris aquilina</i> afford an example of the
    monopolisation of the soil by a single species. In Sikkim Sir
    Joseph Hooker speaks of extensive groves of tree ferns, and in
    the wet regions of the Amazon, Bates<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> describes the whole
    forest glade as forming a “vast fernery.” In a valley in Tahiti
    <i>Alsophila tahitiensis</i> is said to form “a sort of forest almost to
    the exclusion of other ferns<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>.” In the abundance of <i>Glossopteris</i>
    (figs. <a href="#fig334">334</a>, etc.) fronds spread over wide areas of Permo-Carboniferous
    rocks in S. Africa, Australia, and India, we have
    a striking instance of a similar social habit in an extinct fern
    or at least fern-like plant.</p>

  <p><i>Acrostichum aureum</i>, with pinnate fronds several feet long,
    is an example of a recent fern covering immense tracts, but this
    species<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> is more especially interesting as a member of the
    Filicineae characteristic of brackish marshes and the banks of
    tropical rivers in company with Mangrove plants and the
    “Stemless Palm” <i>Nipa</i>. This species exhibits the anatomical
    characters of a water-plant and affords an interesting parallel
    with some Palaeozoic ferns (species of <i>Psaronius</i>) which probably
    grew under similar conditions.</p>

  <h4 id="Anatomy_of_ferns">The Anatomy of Ferns.</h4>

  <p>The text-book accounts of fern-anatomy convey a very inadequate
    idea of the architectural characters displayed by the
    vascular systems of recent genera. When we are concerned
    with the study of extinct plants it is essential to be familiar not
    only with the commoner recent types, but particularly with
    exceptional or aberrant types. The vascular system of many
    ferns consists of strands of xylem composed of scalariform
    tracheae associated with a larger or smaller amount of parenchyma,
    surrounded either wholly or in part (that is concentric
    or bicollateral) by phloem: beyond this is a pericycle, one layer
    or frequently several layers in breadth, limited externally by an
    endodermis, which can usually be readily recognised. The vascular
    strands are embedded in the ground-tissue of the stem
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>consisting of thin-walled parenchyma and, in most ferns, a
    considerable quantity of hard and lignified mechanical tissue.
    The narrow protoxylem elements are usually characterised by a
    spiral form of thickening, but in slow-growing stems the first-formed
    elements are frequently of the scalariform type.</p>

  <p>A study of the anatomy of recent ferns both in the adult
    state and in successive stages of development from the embryo
    has on the whole revealed “a striking parallelism<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>” between
    vascular and sporangial characters in leptosporangiate ferns.
    For a masterly treatment of our knowledge of fern anatomy
    from a phylogenetic point of view reference should be made to
    Mr Tansley’s recently published lectures: within the limits of
    this volume all that is possible is a brief outline of the main
    types of vascular structure illustrated by recent genera.</p>

  <p>To Prof. Jeffrey<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> we owe the term protostele which he applied
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>to a type of stele consisting of a central core of xylem surrounded
    by phloem, pericycle, and endodermis. While admitting that
    steles of this type may sometimes be the result of the modification
    of less simple forms, we may confidently regard the
    protostele as representing the most primitive form of vascular
    system. The genus <i>Lygodium</i> affords an example of a protostelic
    fern; a solid column of xylem tracheae and parenchyma is
    completely encircled by a cylinder of phloem succeeded by a
    multi-layered pericycle and an endodermis of a single layer of
    cells. In this genus the stele is characterised by marginal
    groups of protoxylem; it is exarch. An almost identical type is
    represented by species of <i>Gleichenia</i>, but here the stele is
    mesarch, the protoxylem being slightly internal (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, C).
    <i>Trichomanes scandens</i> (<a href="#fig238">fig. 238</a>) has an exarch protostele like
    that of <i>Lygodium</i>; but, as Boodle<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> has suggested, the protostelic
    form in this case is probably the result of modification of a
    collateral form of stele such as occurs in <i>Trichomanes reniforme</i>
    (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, E). A second type of stele has been described in
    species of <i>Lindsaya</i><a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> in which the xylem includes a small group
    of phloem near the dorsal surface. This <i>Lindsaya</i> type is often
    passed through in the development of “seedling” ferns and may
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>be regarded as a stage in a series leading to another well-marked
    type, the solenostele. The solenostele<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>, a hollow cylinder of
    xylem lined within and without by phloem, pericycle, and endodermis,
    occurs in several genera belonging to different families,
    e.g. <i>Dipteris</i>, species of <i>Pteris</i>, species of <i>Lindsaya</i>, <i>Polypodium</i>,
    <i>Jamesonia</i>, <i>Loxsoma</i>, <i>Gleichenia</i> and other genera. In a smaller
    number of ferns the stele consists of what may be called a
    medullated protostele similar to the common form of stele in
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>: this type is found in species of <i>Schizaea</i> and in
    <i>Platyzoma</i> (<a href="#fig239">fig. 239</a>). It is important to notice that in the
    solenostele and as a rule in the medullated protostele when a
    leaf-trace passes out from the rhizome stele the vascular cylinder
    is interrupted by the formation of a foliar gap (<i>Platyzoma</i><a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>,
    <a href="#fig239">fig. 239</a>, is an exception). This fact has been emphasized
    by Jeffrey<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> who draws a distinction between the Lycopodiaceous
    type of stele, which is not broken by the exit of leaf-traces, and
    the fern stele in which foliar gaps are produced: the former he
    speaks of as the cladosiphonic type (<i>Lycopsida</i>) and the latter as
    the phyllosiphonic (<i>Pteropsida</i>).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The transition to a hollow cylinder of xylem from a protostele
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>may be described as the result of the replacement of some of the
    axial conducting tracheae by parenchyma or other non-vascular
    tissue consequent on an increase in diameter of the whole stele
    and the concentration of the true conducting elements towards
    the periphery<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of the internal cylinder of phloem, pericycle,
    and endodermis in a solenostele is rendered intelligible by a
    study of fern seedlings and by a comparative examination of
    transitional types connecting protosteles and solenosteles through
    medullated protosteles and steles of the <i>Lindsaya</i> type. A
    further stage in stelar evolution is illustrated by what is termed
    the dictyostele, the arrangement of vascular tissue characteristic
    of <i>Nephrodium Filix-mas</i>, <i>Cyathea</i> (<a href="#fig240">fig. 240</a>), <i>Polypodium vulgare</i>
    and many other common ferns.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig240">

  </div>

  <p>If a solenostele is interrupted by leaf-gaps at intervals
    sufficiently close to cause overlapping, a transverse section at
    any part of the stele will show apparently separate curved
    bands of concentrically arranged xylem and phloem, which on
    dissection are seen to represent parts of a continuous lattice-work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
    or a cylinder with the wall pierced by large meshes. The
    manner of evolution of the dictyostele has been ably dealt with
    by Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and other authors. In a few ferns, e.g.
    <i>Matonia pectinata</i><a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>, a transverse section of the stem (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, B)
    reveals the presence of two or in some cases three concentric
    solenosteles with a solid protostele in the centre: this <i>polycylic</i>
    type may be regarded as the expression of the fact that in
    response to the need for an adequate water-supply to the large
    fronds, ferns have increased the conducting channels by a method
    other than by the mere increase of the diameter of a single stele.
    Fig. 237, A, shows the vascular tissue of a petiole of <i>Matonia</i> in
    transverse section.</p>

  <p>The two genera of Osmundaceae, <i>Todea</i> and <i>Osmunda</i>, are
    peculiar among recent ferns in having a vascular cylinder composed
    of separate strands of xylem varying considerably in
    shape and size, from <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>-shaped strands with the concavity
    facing the centre of the stem and with the protoxylem in the
    hollow of the <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>, to oval or more or less circular strands with
    a mesarch protoxylem or without any protoxylem elements
    (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, A, B). These different forms are the expression of the
    change in contour or in structure which the parts of the lattice-work
    undergo at different levels in the stem<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>. Beyond this
    ring of xylem bundles is a continuous sheath of phloem of
    characteristic structure. A transverse section of a stem of
    <i>Osmunda regalis</i> may show 15 or more xylem strands; in <i>O.
    Claytoniana</i> there may be as many as 40. In <i>Todea barbara</i>
    (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, B) the leaf-gaps are shorter, and in consequence of the
    less amount of overlapping the xylem cylinder becomes an
    almost continuous tube. The recent researches of Kidston and
    Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> have resulted in the discovery of fossil
    Osmundaceous stems with a complete xylem ring, the stele
    being of the medullated protostele type; in another extinct
    member of the family the stele consists of a solid xylem core.
    The Osmundaceous type of stele is complicated in <i>O. cinnamomea</i>
    (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, A) by the occurrence of local internal phloem and by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>an internal endodermis, a feature which leads Jeffrey to what
    I believe to be an incorrect conclusion that the vascular arrangement
    found in <i>Osmunda regalis</i> has been evolved by reduction
    from a stele in which the xylem was enclosed within and without
    by phloem. New facts recently brought to light enable us to
    derive the ordinary Osmundaceous type from the protostele
    and solenostele. It is worthy of remark that the Osmundaceae
    occupy a somewhat isolated position among recent ferns; their
    anatomy represents a special type, their sporangia differ in
    several respects from those of other leptosporangiate ferns and in
    some features <i>Osmunda</i> and <i>Todea</i> agree with the Eusporangiate
    ferns. The possession of such distinguishing characters as these
    suggests antiquity; and the facts of palaeobotany, as also the
    present geographical range of the family, confirm the correctness
    of this deduction.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the stelar structure of leptosporangiate fern
    stems, a word must be added in regard to a type of structure
    met with in the Hymenophyllaceae. In this family <i>Trichomanes
    reniforme</i> (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, E) may be regarded, as Boodle suggests, as
    the central type: the stele consists of a ring of metaxylem
    tracheae, the dorsal portion having the form of a flat arch
    and the ventral half that of a straight band. This flattened ring
    of xylem encloses parenchymatous tissue containing scattered
    tracheae some of which are protoxylem elements. In <i>Trichomanes
    radicans</i> the rhizome is stouter than in <i>T. reniforme</i> and
    the stele consists of a greater number of tracheae. The stele
    is cylindrical like that shown in <a href="#fig238">fig. 238</a>, but the centre is occupied
    by two groups of protoxylem and associated parenchyma.
    In <i>Hymenophyllum tunbrigense</i> the stele is of the subcollateral
    type; the ventral plate of the xylem ring has disappeared
    leaving a single strand of xylem with endarch protoxylem and
    completely surrounded by phloem. <i>Trichomanes muscoides</i>
    possesses a still simpler stele consisting of a slender xylem
    strand with phloem on one side only. Reference has already
    been made to the occurrence in this family of the protostelic
    type. The Hymenophyllaceae afford a striking illustration
    of the modification in different directions of stelar structure
    connected with differences in habit, and of the correlation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    demand and supply as shown in the varying amount of conducting
    tissue in the steles of different species.</p>

  <p>The leaf-trace in a great number of ferns is characterised by
    its <span class="sans"><b>C</b></span>-shaped form<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> as seen in transverse section: this in some
    genera, e.g. <i>Matonia</i> (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, A), is complicated by the spiral
    infolding of the free edges of the <span class="sans"><b>C</b></span>; in other ferns (e.g.
    some Cyatheaceae) (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, C) the sides of the <span class="sans"><b>C</b></span> are incurved,
    while in some species the xylem is broken up into a large
    number of separate strands.</p>

  <p>An elaborate treatment of the leaf-traces of ferns was
    published a few years ago by MM. Bertrand and Cornaille<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
    in which the authors show how the various systems of vascular
    tissue in the fronds of ferns maybe derived from a common type.
    As Prof. Chodat<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> justly remarks this important work has not
    received the attention it deserves, the neglect being attributed
    to the strange notation which is adopted<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>.</p>

  <p>The roots of ferns are characterised by a uniformity of plan
    in marked contrast to the wide range of structure met with in
    the stem and to a less extent in the leaves. The xylem may
    consist of a plate of scalariform tracheae with a protoxylem
    group at each end, or the stele may include six or more alternating
    strands of xylem and phloem.</p>

  <h3>II. Marattiales <span class="nobold">(Eusporangiate isosporous Filicales).</span></h3>

  <p>The Marattiaceae, the single family of ferns included in the
    Marattiales, comprise the genera <i>Angiopteris</i>, <i>Archangiopteris</i>,
    <i>Marattia</i>, <i>Danaea</i>, and <i>Kaulfussia</i>, which are for the most part
    tropical in distribution. These genera are characterised by
    eusporangiate sori or synangia, the presence of stipules at the
    base of the petioles, and by the complex arrangement of the
    vascular tissue. In view of the fact that many fossil ferns
    show a close resemblance to the recent Marattiaceae, the surviving
    genera are briefly described. The prothallus is green
    and relatively large.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

  <p><i>Angiopteris.</i> This genus occurs in Polynesia, tropical Asia, and Madagascar;
    it is characterised by a short and thick fleshy stem bearing large
    bipinnate leaves which occasionally show a forking of the rachis<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>, a
    feature reminiscent of some Palaeozoic fern-like fronds. One of the
    large plants of <i>Angiopteris evecta</i> in the Royal Gardens, Kew, bears leaves
    12 feet in length with a stalk 6 inches in diameter at the base. The
    sessile or shortly stalked and rather leathery linear or broadly lanceolate
    pinnules have a prominent midrib and dichotomously branched lateral
    veins. The surface of an old stem is covered with the thick stumps of
    petioles enclosed by pairs of fleshy stipules (<a href="#fig241">fig. 241</a>, A) and bears
    numerous fleshy roots, which hang free in the air or penetrate the soil.
    The young fronds (<a href="#fig220">fig. 220</a>, A) exhibit very clearly the characteristic
    circinate vernation. The proximal part of each primary pinna is characterised
    by a pulvinus-like swelling. The sporangia, in short linear
    elliptical sori near the edge of the pinnules, consist of free sporangia
    (<a href="#fig242">fig. 242</a>, A–D) provided with a peculiar type of “annulus”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>, in the form
    of a narrow band of thicker-walled cells, which extends as a broad strip
    on either side of the apex. An examination of sections through the
    sporangia of <i>Angiopteris</i> in different planes<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> illustrates the difficulty of
    determining the precise nature of the annulus in a petrified sporangium
    which is seen only in one or two planes. Many of the sporangia from the
    English Coal-Measures, compared by authors with those of Leptosporangiate
    ferns, are in all probability referable to the Marattiaceous type.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The vascular system<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> of the stem constitutes a highly complex dictyostelic
    or polycylic type which may consist of as many as nine concentric
    series of strands of xylem surrounded by phloem, with large sieve-tubes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>and a pericycle which abuts on the parenchymatous ground-tissue without
    any definite endodermal layer. A peculiarity in the vascular strands is
    that the first-formed elements of the phloem lie close to the edge of the
    xylem, the metaphloem being therefore centrifugal in its development.
    The ground-tissue is devoid of mechanical tissue and is penetrated by
    roots, a few of which arise from the outer vascular strands while others
    force their way to the surface from the more internal dictyosteles. Leaf-traces,
    consisting of several strands, are given off from the outermost
    cylinder and a segment of the second dictyostele moves out to fill the
    gap formed in the outermost network, while the gap in the second cylinder
    receives compensating strands from the third. A few layers below the
    surface of the petiole there is a ring of thick-walled elements (<i>s</i>, <a href="#fig243">fig. 243</a>),
    and in both petiole and stem numerous mucilage ducts and tannin-sacs
    occur in the ground-tissue. It has been shown by Farmer and Hill<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> that
    in some of the vascular strands in an <i>Angiopteris</i> stem a few secondary
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>tracheae are added to the primary xylem by the activity of the adjacent
    parenchyma. The vascular bundles in the petiole form more or less regular
    concentric series; they have no endodermis and are characterised also by
    the large size of the sieve-tubes (<i>st</i>, <a href="#fig243">fig. 243</a>).</p>

  <p><i>Archangiopteris</i>. This monotypic genus, discovered by Mr Henry in
    South Eastern Yunnan, was described by Christ and Giesenhagen in
    1899<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>. The comparatively slender rhizome has a fairly simple vascular
    system<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. The simply-pinnate leaves bear pinnules like those of <i>Danaea</i>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>but the sori agree with those of <i>Angiopteris</i> except in their greater length
    and in the larger number of sporangia.</p>

  <p><i>Marattia</i>. This genus, which extends “all round the world within the
    tropics<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>,” includes some species which closely resemble <i>Angiopteris</i>, while
    others are characterised by more finely divided leaves with smaller
    ultimate segments. The fleshy stipules occasionally have an irregularly
    pinnatifid form (<a href="#fig241">fig. 241</a>, B). The sporangia are represented by oval
    synangia<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, A; the black patches at the ends of the lateral veins)
    composed of two valves, which on ripening come apart and expose
    two rows of pores formed by the apical dehiscence of the sporangial compartments
    (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, A′, B). In <i>Marattia Kaulfussii</i> the sori are attached
    to the lamina by a short stalk (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, B, B′) and the leaf bears a close
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>resemblance to those of the Umbelliferous genera <i>Anthriscus</i> and <i>Chaerophyllum</i>.
    The vascular system is constructed on the same plan as that of
    <i>Angiopteris</i> but is of simpler form.</p>

  <p><i>Danaea.</i> Danaea, represented by about 14 species confined to tropical
    America, is characterised by simple or simply pinnate leaves with linear
    segments bearing elongated sori extending from the midrib almost to the
    margin of the lamina. Each sorus consists of numerous sporangia in two
    parallel rows united into an oblong mass partially overarched by an
    indusium (<a href="#fig242">fig. 242</a>, E, <i>i</i>) which grows up from the leaf between the sori.
    In the portion of a fertile segment shown in <a href="#fig242">fig. 242</a>, E, the apical pores
    are seen at <i>a</i>; and at <i>b</i>, where the roof of the synangium has been removed,
    the spore-bearing compartments are exposed. The vascular system<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> agrees
    in general plan with that characteristic of the family.</p>

  <p><i>Kaulfussia.</i> The form of the leaf (Vol. I. p. 97, fig. 22) closely resembles
    that of the Horse Chestnut; the stem is a creeping dorsiventral
    rhizome with a vascular system in the form of a “much perforated
    solenostele<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>.” The synangia are circular, with a median depression;
    each sporangial compartment opens by an apical pore on the sloping sides
    of the synangial cup (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, C)<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.</p>

  <p>Copeland has recently described a Marattiaceous leaf which he makes
    the type of a new genus, <i>Macroglossum alidae</i>. The sori are nearer the
    margin than in <i>Angiopteris</i> and are said to consist of a greater number of
    sporangia. The photograph<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> of a single pinna which accompanies the
    brief description hardly affords satisfactory evidence in support of the
    creation of a new genus. The structure of a petiole which I have had
    an opportunity of examining, through the kindness of Mr Hewitt of
    Sarawak, shows no distinctive features.</p>

  <h3 id="Ophioglossales">III. Ophioglossales. <span class="nobold">(Isosporous and Eusporangiate.)</span></h3>

  <p>The three genera, <i>Ophioglossum</i>, <i>Botrychium</i>, and <i>Helminthostachys</i>,
    are characterised by the division of the leaves into a
    sterile and a fertile lobe. The fertile lobe in <i>Ophioglossum</i>
    bears two rows of spherical sporangia sunk in its tissue; in
    <i>Botrychium</i> and <i>Helminthostachys</i> the spores are contained in
    large sporangia with a stout wall<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>. The prothallus is subterranean
    and without chlorophyll. In the British species of
    <i>Ophioglossum</i>, <i>O. vulgatum</i> (the adder’s tongue fern), an almost
    cosmopolitan species, the sterile part of the frond is of oval
    form and has reticulate venation. In <i>O. pendulum</i> and <i>O.</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span><i>palmatum</i> the lamina is deeply lobed. In the genus <i>Botrychium</i>,
    represented in Britain by <i>B. Lunaria</i>, both sterile and
    fertile branches of the frond are pinnately divided, while in
    <i>Helminthostachys</i> the sporangia are borne on sporangiophores
    given off from the margin of the fertile branch of a frond
    similar in habit to a leaf of <i>Helleborus</i>.</p>

  <p>The stem of <i>Ophioglossum</i> is characterised by a dictyostele

    system of the leaf-stalk is also composed of several separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
    strands (<a href="#fig246">fig. 246</a>). In <i>Botrychium</i> the stele is a cylinder of
    xylem surrounded externally by phloem. This genus affords
    the only instance among ferns of a plant in which the addition
    of secondary tracheae occurs on a scale large enough to produce
    a well-defined cylinder of secondary xylem traversed by radial
    rows of medullary-ray cells<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> (<a href="#fig247">fig. 247</a>). The unsatisfactory
    nature of the evidence in regard to the past history of the
    Ophioglossales renders superfluous a fuller treatment of the
    recent species.</p>

  <h4 id="Osmundaceae_21">Osmundaceae.</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">From</span> the Culm of Silesia, Stur<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> described impressions of
    sterile fronds which he named <i>Todea Lipoldi</i> on the ground of
    the similarity of the finely divided pinnules to those of <i>Todea
    superba</i> and other filmy species of the genus. The type-specimen
    of Stur (in the Geological Survey Museum, Vienna)
    affords no information as to sporangial characters and cannot be
    accepted as an authentic record of a Lower Carboniferous
    representative of the family. Another more satisfactory but
    hardly convincing piece of evidence bearing on the presence of
    Osmundaceae in pre-Permian floras has been adduced by
    Renault<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>, who described petrified sporangia from the Culm
    beds of Esnost in France as <i>Todeopsis primaeva</i> (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, F).
    These pyriform sporangia are characterised by the presence of
    a plate of large cells comparable with the subapical group of
    “annulus” cells in the sporangia of the recent species (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>).</p>

  <p>Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> has published a figure of some sporangia described
    by Renault from Autun resembling the Osmundaceous type in
    having a plate of thick-walled cells instead of a true annulus,
    but the plate is larger than the group of cells in the recent
    sporangia, and both sporangia and spores are smaller in the
    fossil. The sporangia from Carboniferous rocks described by
    Weiss as <i>Sturiella</i><a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> bear some resemblance to those of recent
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>Osmundaceae, but there is no adequate reason for referring
    them to this family.</p>

  <p>The generic name <i>Pteridotheca</i> is employed by Scott as a
    convenient designation for unassigned petrified sporangia of
    Palaeozoic age with an annulus and other characters indicating
    fern-affinity. In the species <i>P. Butterworthi</i><a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> the sporangia are
    characterised by a group of large cells suggesting comparison
    with the annulus, or what represents the annulus, in Osmundaceae
    and Marattiaceae. Scott has also described a sporangium
    from the Coal-Measures containing germinating spores<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>;
    the structure is similar to that of recent Osmundaceous sporangia,
    and it is interesting to note that germinating spores have been
    observed in the recent species <i>Todea hymenophylloides</i><a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>.</p>

  <p>Additional evidence of the same kind is afforded by fertile
    specimens of a quadripinnate fern with deeply dissected oval-lanceolate
    pinnules described by Zeiller from the Coal-Measures
    of Heraclea in Asia Minor as <i>Kidstonia heracleensis</i><a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> (fig.
    256, E). Carbonised sporangia were found at the base of
    narrow lobes of the ultimate segments and, as seen in fig.
    256, E, the sporangial wall is distinguished by a plate of larger
    cells occupying a position like that of the “annulus” of recent
    Osmundaceae. Zeiller regards the sporangia as intermediate
    between those of Osmundaceae and Schizaeaceae. From the
    same locality Zeiller describes another frond bearing somewhat
    similar sporangia as <i>Sphenopteris</i> (<i>Discopteris</i>) <i>Rallii</i> (fig.
    256, D)<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>: the term <i>Discopteris</i> was instituted by Stur for
    fertile fronds referred by him to the Marattiaceae<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is by no means safe to assume that these and such Upper
    Carboniferous sporangia as Bower<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> compared with those of
    <i>Todea</i> were borne on plants possessing the anatomical characters
    of Osmundaceae rather than those of the extinct Palaeozoic
    family Botryopterideae. This brings us to the important fact,
    first pointed out by Renault, that the Botryopterideae are
    essentially generalised ferns exhibiting many points of contact
    with the Osmundaceae<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>. It is clear that whether or not we
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>are justified in tracing the Osmundaceae as far back as the
    Lower Carboniferous period, some of the characteristics of the
    family were already foreshadowed in rocks of this age.</p>

  <p>Through a fortunate accident of preservation, unequivocal
    evidence of the existence of Osmundaceae in the Palaeozoic era
    is supplied by the Russian Upper Permian genera <i>Zalesskya</i>
    and <i>Thamnopteris</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Zalesskya.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic title has been instituted by Kidston and
    Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> for two Russian stems of Upper Permian
    age, one of which was named by Eichwald<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> <i>Chelepteris gracilis</i>,
    but the probability that the type of the genus <i>Chelepteris</i> is
    generically distinct from Eichwald’s species necessitated a new
    designation for the Permian fern.</p>

  <p>In habit the stem of <i>Zalesskya</i> resembles that of an
    <i>Osmunda</i> or a <i>Todea</i>, but it differs in the possession of a stele
    composed of a continuous cylinder or solid column of xylem
    surrounded by phloem, and by the differentiation of the xylem
    into two concentric zones. The leaves are represented by
    petiole-bases only; the sporangia are unknown. The stem and
    leaf-base anatomy fully justifies the inclusion of <i>Zalesskya</i> in
    the Osmundaceae.</p>

  <h6><i>Zalesskya gracilis</i> (Eichwald). <a href="#fig248">Fig. 248</a>.</h6>

  <p>The type-specimen is a partially decorticated stem, from
    Upper Permian beds in Russia, provided with a single stele,
    13 mm. in diameter, surrounded by a broad thin-walled inner
    cortex containing numerous leaf-traces and occasional roots: this
    was doubtless succeeded by a sclerotic outer cortex. In its
    main features <i>Zalesskya gracilis</i> agrees closely with <i>Z. diploxylon</i>
    represented in <a href="#fig249">fig. 249</a>. The stele consists of a continuous
    cylinder of xylem exhibiting a fairly distinct differentiation
    into two zones, (i) a broader outer zone of narrower scalariform
    tracheae (<i>x ii</i>, <a href="#fig248">fig. 248</a>) in which 20 to 25 protoxylem strands (<i>px</i>)
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>occur just within the edge, (ii) an inner zone of broader
    and shorter tracheae (<a href="#fig248">fig. 248</a>, <i>x i</i>). The protoxylem elements
    (<i>px</i>, <a href="#fig248">fig. 248</a>) are characterised by a single series of scalariform
    pits, while the metaxylem elements have multiseriate pits like
    those on the water-conducting elements of recent Osmundaceae.
    The tracheae show an interesting histological character in the
    absence of the middle substance of their walls, a feature recognised
    by Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> in many recent ferns. External to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>the xylem and separated from it by a parenchymatous sheath
    is a ring of phloem, <i>ph</i>, composed of large sieve-tubes and
    parenchyma separated from the inner cortex by a pericycle
    4 to 5 layers in breadth. The occurrence of a few sclerotic
    cells beyond the broad inner cortex points to the former
    existence of a thick-walled outer cortex. The leaf-traces are
    given off as mesarch strands from the edge of the xylem; they
    begin as prominences opposite the protoxylem and become
    gradually detached as xylem bundles, at first oblong in transverse
    section, then assuming a slightly crescentic and reniform
    shape, while the mesarch protoxylem strand takes up an
    endarch position. As a trace passes further out the curvature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
    increases and the protoxylem strands undergo repeated bifurcation;
    it assumes in fact the form and general type of structure
    met with in the leaf-traces of <i>Todea</i> and <i>Osmunda</i>. Numerous
    diarch roots, given off from the stele at points just below the
    outgoing leaf-traces, pass outwards in a sinuous horizontal
    course through the cortex of the stem.</p>

  <p>In <i>Zalesskya gracilis</i> the xylem cylinder was probably wider

      diploxylon</i><a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>, in all probability from the same Russian locality,
    there can be little doubt that the xylem was originally solid to
    the centre (<a href="#fig249">fig. 249</a>). In this species also the phloem forms
    a continuous band (<i>ph</i>, <a href="#fig249">fig. 249</a>) consisting of four to six layers
    of sieve-tubes.</p>

  <p>In 1849 Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> proposed the name <i>Thamnopteris</i> for
    a species of fern from the Upper Permian of Russia originally
    described by Eichwald as <i>Anomopteris Schlechtendalii</i>. A
    new name was employed by Brongniart on the ground that the
    fossil was not generically identical with the species previously
    named by him <i>Anomopteris Mougeotii</i><a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>. Eichwald’s specimen has
    been thoroughly investigated by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>.
    The stem (Frontispiece) agrees in habit with those of <i>Zalesskya</i>
    and recent Osmundaceae; on the exposed leaf-bases the action of
    the weather has etched out the horse-shoe form of the vascular
    strands and laid bare numerous branched roots boring their
    way through the petiole stumps. The centre of the stem is
    occupied by a protostele 13 mm. in diameter consisting of solid
    xylem separated by a parenchymatous sheath from a cylinder
    of phloem. The xylem is composed mainly of an axial column
    of short and broad reticulately pitted tracheae (<a href="#fig250">fig. 250</a>, <i>b</i> and
    Frontispiece), distinguished from the sharply contrasted peripheral
    zone of normal scalariform elements, <i>a</i>, by their thinner
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>walls and more irregular shape. The protoxylem, <i>px</i>, is represented
    by groups of narrower elements rather deeply immersed
    in the peripheral part of the metaxylem. A many-layered
    pericycle, <i>per</i>, and traces of an endodermis, <i>en</i>, succeed the
    phloem, <i>ph</i>, which is characterised by several rows of large
    contiguous sieve-tubes; beyond the endodermis is a broad thin-walled
    inner cortex. The leaf-traces arise as in <i>Zalesskya</i>,
    but the protoxylem in <i>Thamnopteris</i> is at first central; as the
    trace passes outwards a group of parenchyma appears immediately
    internal to the protoxylem elements and gradually
    assumes the form of a bay of thin-walled tissue on the inner
    concave face of the curved xylem. The next stage is the
    repeated division of the protoxylem strand until, in the sclerotic
    outer cortex, the traces acquire the Osmundaceous structure
    (<a href="#fig312">fig. 312</a>, A, p. 453). The petiole bases have stipular wings as
    in <i>Todea</i> and <i>Osmunda</i>.</p>

    the structure of the protostele, which in <i>Thamnopteris</i> and
    probably in <i>Zalesskya diploxylon</i> consists of solid xylem surrounded
    by phloem: this may be regarded as the primitive
    form of the Osmundaceous stele. In <i>Osmunda regalis</i> and in
    other recent species of the genus the xylem cylinder has the form
    of a lattice-work; in other words, the departure of each leaf-trace
    makes a gap in the xylem and the overlapping of the
    foliar-gaps results in the separation of the xylem into a number
    of distinct bundles. In <i>Zalesskya gracilis</i> the continuity of
    the xylem is not broken by overlapping gaps; in this it agrees
    with <i>Lepidodendron</i>. In <i>Thamnopteris</i> the centre of the stele
    was occupied by a peculiar form of xylem obviously ill-adapted
    for conduction, but probably serving for water-storage and
    comparable with the short and broad tracheae in <i>Megaloxylon</i><a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>.
    There is clearly a well-marked difference in stelar anatomy
    between these two Permian genera and <i>Todea</i> and <i>Osmunda</i>:
    this difference appears less when viewed in the light of the
    facts revealed by a study of the Jurassic species <i>Osmundites
      Dunlopi</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

  <p>As possible examples of Triassic Osmundaceae reference
    may be made to some species included in Stur’s genus
    <i>Speirocarpus</i><a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>. <i>S. virginiensis</i> was originally described by
    Fontaine<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> from the Upper Triassic rocks of Virginia as
    <i>Lonchopteris virginiensis</i> (<a href="#fig251">fig. 251</a>) and has recently been figured
    by Leuthardt<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> from the Keuper of Basel. The sporangia, which
    are scattered over the lower surface of the pinnules, are
    described as globose-elliptical and as having a rudimentary
    apical annulus; no figures have been published. In habit
    the frond agrees with <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>, but the lateral
    veins form an anastomosing system like that in the Palaeozoic
    genus <i>Lonchopteris</i> (<a href="#fig290">fig. 290</a>, B). There would seem to be an <i>a
    priori</i> probability of this species being a representative of the
    Osmundaceae and not, as Stur believed, of the Marattiaceae.
    Seeing that <i>Lonchopteris</i> is a designation of a purely provisional
    kind, it would be convenient to institute a new generic name
    for Triassic species having the Lonchopteris venation, which
    there are good reasons for regarding as Osmundaceous ferns.</p>

  <p>Similarly <i>Speirocarpus tenuifolius</i> (Emmons) (= <i>Acrostichites
    tenuifolius</i> Font.), which resembles <i>Todites Williamsoni</i> (see
    p. 339) not only in habit and in the distribution of the sporangia
    but also in the venation, is probably an Osmundaceous species.</p>

  <h5><i>Osmundites.</i></h5>

  <p class="hang"><i>Osmundites Dunlopi</i>, Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>, <a href="#fig252">fig. 252</a>.</p>

  <p>This species was found in Jurassic rocks in the Otago district
    of New Zealand in association with <i>Cladophlebis denticulata</i><a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
    (<a href="#fig257">fig. 257</a>). The type-specimen forms part of a stem 17 mm. in
    diameter surrounded by a broad mass of crowded leaf-bases.
    The stele consists of an almost continuous xylem ring (<a href="#fig252">fig. 252</a>)
    enclosing a wide pith: the phloem and inner cortex are not
    preserved but the peripheral region of the stem is occupied by
    a sclerotic outer cortex. The mass of encasing leaf-bases
    resolves itself on closer inspection into zones of foliage-leaf
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>petioles and the petioles of scale-leaves with an aborted lamina.
    A similar association of two forms of leaf is seen in the existing
    American species <i>Osmunda Claytoniana</i> and <i>O. cinnamomea</i>. The
    cortex and armour of leaf-bases are penetrated by numerous
    diarch roots. The xylem cylinder, six to seven tracheae broad,
    is characterised by the narrower diameter of its innermost elements
    and—an important point—by the fact that the detachment
    of a leaf-trace does not break the continuity of the xylem
    cylinder (<a href="#fig252">fig. 252</a>). Each leaf-trace is at first elliptical in
    section; it then becomes curved inwards and gradually assumes
    the horse-shoe form as in <i>Zalesskya</i> and in the recent species.
    The single endarch protoxylem becomes subdivided until in
    the petiole it is represented by 20 or more strands.</p>

      <i>Osmundites Dunlopi</i> Kidst. and G.-V. Portion of xylem showing the departure of a leaf-trace. (After Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan; × 36.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the continuity of the xylem cylinder this species of
    <i>Osmundites</i> shows a closer approach to <i>Todea barbara</i> or
    <i>T. superba</i> (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, B) than to species of <i>Osmunda</i>; it differs
    from <i>Zalesskya</i> in having reached a further stage in the reduction
    of a solid protostele to one composed of a xylem
    cylinder enclosing a pith. This difference is of the same kind
    as that which distinguishes the stele of <i>Lepidodendron rhodumnense</i>
    from <i>L. Harcourtii</i>. In <i>Lepidodendron</i> short tracheae
    occasionally occur on the inner edge of the xylem cylinder, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
    in recent species of <i>Todea</i> the same kind of reduced tracheae are
    met with on the inner edge of the xylem<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>. In both cases the
    short tracheae are probably vestiges of an axial strand of conducting
    elements which in the course of evolution have been
    converted into parenchymatous cells. In <i>Lepidodendron vasculare</i>
    the mixed parenchyma and short tracheae in the centre
    of the stele represent an intermediate stage in xylem reduction,
    and the arrangement in vertical rows of the medullary parenchyma
    in <i>Lepidodendron</i> is precisely similar to that described by
    Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan in <i>Thamnopteris</i>. In both cases
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>the rows of superposed short cells have probably been produced
    by the transverse septation of cells which began by elongating
    as if to form conducting tubes and ended by assuming the form
    of vertical series of parenchymatous elements.</p>

  <p>In another Jurassic species, <i>Osmundites Gibbiana</i><a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>, the xylem
    is of the <i>Osmunda</i> type and consists of about 20 strands instead
    of a continuous or almost continuous cylinder.</p>

  <p>This species was founded on a specimen obtained by Mr

    consists of several pieces of a stem (<a href="#fig253">fig. 253</a>) which reached
    a length of about 90 cm. On the weathered surface the
    remains of petiole-bases are clearly seen and on the reverse
    side of the smaller piece shown in the figure numerous sinuous
    roots are present in association with the leaf-stalks. The
    depression <i>c</i> in the larger specimen may mark the position
    of a branch: at <i>a</i> <a href="#fig253">fig. 253</a> (enlarged in <a href="#fig254">fig. 254</a>, <i>a</i>) the

  </div>

  <p>An examination of the internal structure of the South
    African stem by Dr Kidston and Mr Gwynne-Vaughan has
    revealed many interesting features, which will be fully described
    in Part IV. of their Monograph on fossil Osmundaceous stems.
    I am greatly indebted to these authors for allowing me to
    publish the following note contributed by Dr Kidston:—</p>

  <p>“The section of <i>Osmundites Kolbei</i> Seward, shown in <a href="#fig255">fig. 255</a>,
    presents the usual appearance of an Osmundaceous stock. The
    parts contained in this section are the stele, inner and outer
    cortex and a portion of the surrounding mantle of concrescent
    leaf-bases. The whole specimen has suffered much from pressure,
    but if restored to its original form the xylem ring must have
    been about 19 mm. in diameter. The number of xylem strands
    is about fifty-six and several of them are more or less joined
    as in the modern genus <i>Todea</i>. The tracheae are of the typical
    Osmundaceous type, that is to say, the pits are actual perforations
    and several series of them occur on each wall of the larger
    tracheae.</p>

  <p>“The most interesting structural characteristic of <i>Osmundites
    Kolbei</i> is not well seen in the figure owing to the compression
    of the xylem ring. This consists in the occurrence of tracheae
    in the pith. In fact, we have here a mixed pith, composed
    of parenchyma and true tracheae, a condition which connects
    the <i>Osmundaceae</i> with a parenchymatous medulla with those
    possessing a solid xylem stele like <i>Zalesskya</i> and <i>Thamnopteris</i>
    and so completes the series of transitions extending from the
    older and solid-steled forms to the modern medullated members
    of the <i>Osmundaceae</i>.”</p>

  <h6><i>Osmundites skidegatensis</i>, Penhallow.</h6>

  <p>This lower Cretaceous Canadian species, first described by Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
    and more recently by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>, is
    remarkable for the large size of the stem, the stele alone having
    a diameter of 2·4 cm. Penhallow figures a fragment of a leaf
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>bearing a superficial resemblance to that of <i>Osmunda Claytoniana</i>,
    which may be the foliage borne by <i>Osmundites skidegatensis</i>.
    The xylem cylinder is broken by the exit of leaf-traces into 50
    or more strands varying in size and shape, and it is noteworthy
    that the phloem is also interrupted as each leaf-trace is given
    off. In recent species the xylem cylinder is almost always
    interrupted, but the phloem retains its continuity. In the
    Canadian fossil an internal band of phloem occurs between the
    xylem and the pith, and this joins the external phloem at each
    leaf-gap. This internal phloem finds an interesting parallel in
    certain recent species<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>, but in these the internal and external
    phloem do not meet at the foliar gaps as they do in the extinct
    type. In <i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i> the internal phloem occurs
    only at the regions of branching of the stem stele; in the fossil
    it is always present.</p>

  <p>It is clear that <i>Osmundites skidegatensis</i> represents the most
    complex type of stem so far recognised in the Osmundaceae; it
    illustrates a stage in elaboration of the primitive protostele in
    advance of that reached by any existing species.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>The primitive Osmundaceous stele was composed of solid
    xylem surrounded by phloem (<i>Thamnopteris</i> and <i>Zalesskya</i>);
    at a later stage the xylem cylinder lost its inner zone of
    wide and short tracheae and assumed the form seen in
    <i>Osmundites Kolbei</i>, in which the centre of the stele consists of
    parenchyma with some tracheae. Another type is represented
    by <i>O. Dowkeri</i> in which the pith is composed wholly of parenchyma
    and the xylem ring is continuous. From this type,
    by expansion of the xylem ring and by the formation of overlapping
    leaf-gaps, the form represented by <i>Osmunda regalis</i> was
    reached. <i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>, with internal phloem in the
    regions of stelar branching, probably represents a further stage,
    as Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan believe, in increasing complexity
    due to the introduction of phloem from without through
    gaps produced by the branching of the stele. In <i>Osmundites
    skidegatensis</i> the leaf-gaps became wider and the external phloem
    projected deeper into the stele until a continuous internal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>phloem zone was produced. This most elaborate type proved
    less successful than the simpler forms which still survive.</p>

  <h6><i>Osmundites Sturii.</i></h6>

  <p>Impressions of fertile pinnae with narrow linear segments
    bearing exannulate sporangia described by Raciborski from
    Lower Jurassic rocks in Poland as <i>Osmunda Sturii</i><a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> may with
    some hesitation be included in the list of Mesozoic Osmundaceae.</p>

  <h6><i>Osmundites Dowkeri.</i></h6>

  <p>Under this name Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> described a petrified stem from
    Lower Eocene beds at Herne Bay, which in the structure of the
    stele agrees closely with the Jurassic species <i>O. Gibbiana</i> and
    conforms to the normal Osmundaceous type. It is possible,
    as Gardner and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> suggested, that the foliage of
    this species may be represented by some sterile <i>Osmunda</i>-like
    fragments recorded from the Middle Bagshot beds of Bovey
    Tracey and Bournemouth as <i>Osmunda lignitum</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Todites.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> has been applied to fossil ferns exhibiting
    in the structure of the sporangia and in the general habit of the
    fertile fronds a close resemblance to the recent species <i>Todea
    barbara</i> (<a href="#fig221">fig. 221</a>, D, p. 286).</p>

  <p>It is hopeless to attempt to arrive at satisfactory conclusions
    in regard to the applicability of the name <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>
    to the numerous fronds from Jurassic and Rhaetic rocks,
    agreeing more or less closely with Brongniart’s type-specimen.
    Specimens from the Rhaetic may not be specifically identical
    with those from the Jurassic; the main point is that, whether
    actually identical or not, both sets of fossils clearly represent the
    same general type of Osmundaceous fern<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> and may for present
    purposes be included under the same designation. The above
    synonymy, though by no means complete<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>, serves to illustrate
    the confusion which has existed in regard to this widely spread
    type of Mesozoic fern.</p>

  <p><i>Todites Williamsoni</i> may be briefly described as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond bipinnate; long linear pinnae (20–30 cm.) of uniform breadth
      arise at an acute angle, or in the lower part of a frond, almost at right
      angles, from a stout rachis. Closely set pinnules attached by a broad
      base; slightly falcate, the side towards the rachis strongly convex and the
      outer margin straight or concave and bulged outwards towards the base of
      each segment, margin usually entire, or it may be slightly lobed. Fertile
      pinnules similar to the sterile; sporangia of the Osmundaceous type and
      often scattered over the whole lower surface of the lamina (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, B,
      B′, G). Venation of the <i>Cladophlebis</i> type (cf. <a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, A).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is not always easy to distinguish <i>Todites Williamsoni</i> from
    <i>Cladophlebis denticulata</i>, another common Jurassic fern, but in the
    latter the pinnules are usually longer and relatively narrower and
    the rachis is more slender (cf. <a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, B and 257). Schenk<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> and
    Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> have shown that the sporangia of <i>Todites</i> conform
    in the absence of a true annulus to those of <i>Todea</i> (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, G)
    and <i>Osmunda</i>. Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> has recently figured a group of spores
    of <i>Todites Williamsoni</i> in illustration of the use of the treatment
    of carbonised impressions with nitric acid and potassium
    chlorate. This species, though widely distributed in Jurassic
    rocks, is hardly distinguishable from the German Rhaetic fronds
    figured by Schenk from Bayreuth as <i>Acrostichites Goeppertianus</i><a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>or from other fossils referred to an unnecessarily large number of
    species by Fontaine<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> from Upper Triassic rocks of Virginia<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>.</p>

  <p>It would seem from the paucity of later records of Osmundaceae
    that the family reached its zenith in the Jurassic era.
    When we pass to the later Tertiary and more recent deposits
    evidence is afforded in regard to the geographical range of
    <i>Osmunda regalis</i>. It has been shown to occur in the Pliocene
    forest-bed of Norfolk<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> as well as in Palaeolithic and Neolithic
    deposits<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>.</p>

    represents in all probability an Osmundaceous fern closely allied
    to <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>. The same species is described by
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> from Rhaetic rocks of Tonkin and very similar types
    are figured by Leuthardt<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> from Upper Triassic rocks of Basel

    the same age in Virginia.</p>

  <h5><i>Cladophlebis.</i></h5>

  <p>The generic name <i>Cladophlebis</i> was instituted by Brongniart
    for Mesozoic fern fronds characterised by ultimate segments of
    linear or more or less falcate form attached to the pinnae by
    the whole of the base, as in the Palaeozoic genus <i>Pecopteris</i>,
    possessing a midrib strongly marked at the base and dividing
    towards the distal end of the lamina into finer branches and
    giving off secondary forked and arched veins at an acute
    angle. The term is generally restricted to Mesozoic fern fronds
    which, on account of the absence or imperfection of fertile pinnae,
    cannot be safely assigned to a particular family. In the case of
    the species described below, the evidence in regard to systematic
    position, though not conclusive, is sufficiently strong to justify
    its inclusion in the Osmundaceae.</p>

  <p>This species is often confused<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> with <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>.
    The name <i>Pecopteris whitbiensis</i> has been used by different
    writers for Jurassic fronds which are undoubtedly specifically
    distinct: specimens so named by Brongniart should be referred
    to <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>, while <i>P. whitbiensis</i> of Lindley and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>Hutton<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> is Brongniart’s <i>Cladophlebis denticulata</i>. It is impossible
    to determine with accuracy the numerous examples
    described as <i>Pecopteris whitbiensis</i>, <i>Asplenium whitbiense</i>,
    <i>Cladophlebis Albertsii</i> (a Wealden species<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>), <i>Asplenium</i>, or
    <i>Cladophlebis</i>, <i>nebbense</i><a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>, etc., from Jurassic and Rhaetic strata.
    The <i>Cladophlebis denticulata</i> form of frond is one of the
    commonest in recent ferns; it is represented by such species as
    <i>Onoclea Struthopteris</i>, <i>Pteris arguta</i>, <i>Sadleria sp.</i>, <i>Gleichenia
    dubia</i>, <i>Alsophila lunulata</i>, <i>Cyathea dealbata</i>, and species of
    <i>Polypodium</i>. It is, therefore, not surprising to find records of
    this Mesozoic species from many localities and horizons. All
    that we can do is to point out what appear to be the most
    probable cases of identity among the numerous examples of
    fronds of this type from Mesozoic rocks, particularly Rhaetic
    and Jurassic, in different parts of the world. The name <i>Cladophlebis
    denticulata</i> may be employed in a comprehensive sense
    for fronds showing the following characters:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Leaf large, bipinnate, with long spreading pinnae borne on a comparatively
      slender rachis. Pinnules, in nearly all cases, sterile, reaching a
      length of 3–4cm., acutely pointed, finely denticulate or entire, attached
      by the whole of the base (<a href="#fig257">fig. 257</a>). In the apical region the pinnules
      become shorter and broader. Venation of the <i>Cladophlebis</i> type (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, A).
      Fertile pinnules rather straighter than the sterile, characterised by
      linear sori parallel to the lateral veins (<a href="#fig258">fig. 258</a>).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In endeavouring to distinguish specifically between fronds
    showing a general agreement in habit with <i>C. denticulata</i>,
    special attention should be paid to venation characters, the
    shape of the pinnules, the relation of the two edges of the
    lamina to one another, and to the amount of curvature of the
    whole pinnule. Unless the material is abundant, it is often
    impossible to distinguish between characters of specific value
    and others which are the expression of differences in age or of
    position on a large frond, to say nothing of the well-known
    variability which is amply illustrated by recent ferns. It is
    remarkable that very few specimens are known which throw
    any light on the nature of the fertile pinnae. Fig. 258 represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
    an impression from the Inferior Oolite rocks of the
    Yorkshire coast in which the exposed upper surface of the
    pinnules shows a series of parallel ridges following the course
    of the lateral veins and no doubt formed by oblong sori on the
    lower surface. There can be little doubt that the specimen
    figured by Lindley and Hutton and by others as <i>Pecopteris
    undans</i><a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> is, as Nathorst suggests, a portion of a fertile frond of
    <i>C. denticulata</i>. A fertile specimen of a frond resembling in
    habit <i>C. denticulata</i>, which Fontaine has described from the
    Jurassic rocks of Oregon as <i>Danaeopsis Storrsii</i><a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>, exhibits, as
    that author points out, a superficial resemblance to the specimen
    named by Lindley and Hutton <i>Pecopteris undans</i>. There is,
    however, no adequate reason for referring the American
    fragment to the Marattiaceae. In the absence of sporangia we
    cannot speak confidently as to the systematic position of this
    common type; but there are fairly good grounds for the assertion
    that some at least of the fronds described under this name
    are those of Osmundaceae. The English specimen shown in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span><a href="#fig258">fig. 258</a> is very similar to some Indian fossils figured by Feistmantel
    as <i>Asplenites macrocarpus</i><a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>, which are probably identical
    with <i>Pecopteris australis</i> Morris<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>, a fern that is indistinguishable
    from <i>Cladophlebis denticulata</i>. Renault<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> figured a fertile specimen
    of the Australian fossil as <i>Todea australis</i>, which agrees
    very closely with that shown in <a href="#fig258">fig. 258</a>, and the sporangia
    figured by the French author are of the Osmundaceous type.
    Another example of a fertile specimen is afforded by a Rhaetic
    fern from Franconia, <i>Asplenites ottonis</i>, which is probably
    identical with <i>Alethopteris Roesserti</i> Presl [= <i>Cladophlebis</i>
    (<i>Todites</i>) <i>Roesserti</i>], a plant closely resembling <i>Cladophlebis
    denticulata</i>. Another argument in favour of including <i>C. denticulata</i>
    in the Osmundaceae is supplied by the association of
    pinnae of this type with the petrified stem of <i>Osmundites
    Dunlopi</i> recorded by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan.</p>

  <h4 id="Schizaeaceae_21">Schizaeaceae.</h4>

  <p>Evidence bearing on the existence of this family in Carboniferous
    floras is by no means decisive. The generic name
    <i>Aneimites</i> proposed by Dawson<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> for some Devonian Canadian
    plants resembling species of the recent genus <i>Aneimia</i>, and
    adopted by White<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> for a species from the Pottsville beds of
    Virginia, is misleading. The Canadian plants give no indication
    of the nature of the reproductive organs, and the fronds
    described by White are, as he shows, those of a Pteridosperm
    and bore seeds.</p>

  <p>An examination of the suspiciously diagrammatic drawings
    published by Corda<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> of the small fertile pinnules of a Carboniferous
    fern from Bohemia, which he named <i>Senftenbergia
    elegans</i>, leads us to conclude that the sporangia are almost
    certainly those of a Schizaeaceous species. The small linear
    pinnules bear two rows of sessile sporangia, singly as in recent
    Schizaeaceae and not in sori, characterised by 4–5 rows of
    regular annular cells (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, A) surrounding the apex. It
    has already been pointed out that the apical annulus of recent
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>Schizaeaceae, though normally one row deep, may consist in
    part at least of two rows. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> examined specimens of
    Corda’s species and decided in favour of a Schizaeaceous
    affinity; he describes the sporangia as 0·85–0·95 mm. in length,
    with 3 to 5 and occasionally only two rows of cells in the apical
    annulus. Zeiller’s figures (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, A) confirm the impression
    that Corda’s drawings are more beautiful than accurate. Stur<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>,
    on the other hand, who first pointed out that the type-specimens
    of <i>Senftenbergia</i> came from the Radnitz beds of Bohemia and
    not from the Coal-Measures, convinced himself that the
    sporangia have no true annulus (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, E). He describes them
    as characterised by a comparatively strong wall and by the
    presence of a band of narrow vertical cells marking the line of
    dehiscence, features which lead him to assign the plant to the
    Marattiales, a group which seems to have exercised a dominating
    influence over his judgment. In a later publication Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
    replies to Stur’s criticism but adheres to his original opinion.
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>, while expressing himself in favour of Marattiaceous
    affinity, recognises that Zeiller’s arguments cannot be
    set aside.</p>

  <p>The question must remain open until further evidence is
    forthcoming; but it would seem that this Carboniferous type,
    not as yet recognised in Britain, possessed sporangia having a
    distinct resemblance to those of the Schizaeaceae, though this
    similarity does not amount to proof of the existence of the
    family in the Palaeozoic era.</p>

  <p>Palaeozoic floras may be described as rich in generalised
    types, types foreshadowing lines of evolution, which in the
    course of ages led to a sorting and a redistribution of characters.
    It may be that <i>Senftenbergia</i> is one of these generalised types.</p>

  <p>It is not until we ascend the geological series as far as the
    older Jurassic rocks that we meet with a type which can with
    confidence be classed with the Schizaeaceae, as least so far as
    sporangial characters are concerned. The species <i>Klukia exilis</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>is selected as the best known and most widely-spread representative
    of Jurassic Schizaeaceae.</p>

  <h6><i>Klukia exilis</i> (Phillips)<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>. Fig. 259.</h6>

  <p>The generic name <i>Klukia</i> was proposed by Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> for a
    species originally described by Phillips<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> from the Inferior Oolite
    of the Yorkshire coast as <i>Pecopteris exilis</i>. Bunbury’s<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> discovery
    (supplemented by additional evidence obtained by Raciborski)
    of well-preserved sporangia justified the substitution of a
    distinctive designation for the provisional term <i>Pecopteris</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The species may be defined as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond tripinnate, of the <i>Cladophlebis</i> type; pinnae linear, lanceolate,
      attached to the rachis at a wide angle. Ultimate segments short and
      linear, entire or, in the lower part of a frond, crenulate, 5 mm. long or
      occasionally longer. Sporangia 0·5 mm. in length, borne singly on the lower
      surface of the lamina in a row on each side of the midrib.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A re-examination<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> of the specimen described by Bunbury
    confirmed his account of the structure of the sporangia. The
    pinna shown in <a href="#fig259">fig. 259</a> is characterised by unusually small
    fertile pinnules some of which bear 10 sporangia in two rows;
    the annulus includes about 14 cells. Fertile specimens of this
    and similar forms are figured by Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> from Jurassic rocks
    of Poland, and good examples of the English species may be seen
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>in the Leckenby collection, Cambridge, in the British Museum,
    the museums of Manchester, Scarborough, and other places.</p>

  <p>It is possible that specimens referred to <i>K. exilis</i> by
    Yokoyama<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> from Wealden strata in Japan may afford evidence
    of the persistence of the species beyond the Jurassic era, but in
    view of the close resemblance of the sterile fronds described
    from Wealden strata as <i>Cladophlebis Brownii</i>[2] and <i>C. Dunkeri</i><a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
    to those of <i>Klukia exilis</i>, identity can be established only by an
    examination of fertile specimens. A Jurassic fern recently
    described by Yabe<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> from Korea as <i>Cladophlebis koraiensis</i> may
    be identical with <i>K. exilis</i> and there is little doubt as to the
    existence of the species in Jurassic Caucasian strata<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>.</p>

  <p>This Wealden fern<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> has been doubtfully assigned to the
    Schizaeaceae on the ground of the resemblance of the sterile
    fronds to those of some species of <i>Aneimia</i>, and because of the
    difference between the sterile and fertile pinnae (Fig. 260).
    <i>Ruffordia</i> cannot be regarded as a well authenticated member

  <p>Fragments of forked pinnules, agreeing very closely in venation
    and general appearance with recent species of <i>Lygodium</i>,
    have been identified by Gardner and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> from
    English Eocene beds and by Knowlton from the Miocene beds of
    the Yellowstone Park<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> as <i>Lygodium Kaulfussi</i> Heer (<a href="#fig261">fig. 261</a>, B).
    Despite the absence of sporangia it is probable that these
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>fragments are correctly referred to the Schizaeaceae. The
    sterile and fertile specimens figured by Heer<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> from Tertiary beds
    of Switzerland agree very closely with recent examples of
    <i>Lygodium</i>. Similar though perhaps less convincing evidence
    of the existence of this family in Europe is furnished by
    Saporta<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>, who described two Eocene species from France.</p>

  <h4 id="Gleicheniaceae">Gleicheniaceae.</h4>

  <p>The application by Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> and other earlier writers of
    the generic name <i>Gleichenites</i> to examples of Palaeozoic ferns
    was not justified by any satisfactory evidence. One of Goeppert’s
    species, <i>Gleichenites neuropteroides</i>, is identical with <i>Neuropteris
    heterophylla</i><a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>, a plant now included in the Pteridosperms.</p>

  <p>The resemblance of sporangia and sori, whether preserved
    as carbonised impressions or as petrified material, from Carboniferous
    rocks, to those of recent species of Gleicheniaceae
    is in many cases at least the result of misinterpretation of
    deceptive appearances. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> drew attention to the
    Gleichenia-like structure of some sections of sporangia from
    the English Coal-Measures, but he did not realise the ease with
    which sections of Marattiaceous sporangia in different planes
    may be mistaken for those of annulate (leptosporangiate)
    sporangia. In the regular dichotomous habit of Carboniferous
    fronds described as species of <i>Diplothmema</i> (Stur) and <i>Mariopteris</i>
    (Zeiller)<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> we have a close correspondence with the leaves of
    <i>Gleichenia</i>, but the common occurrence of dichotomous branching
    among ferns is sufficient reason for regarding this feature as
    an untrustworthy criterion of relationship. It is, however,
    interesting to find that in addition to the existence of some
    Upper Carboniferous ferns with sori like those of recent Gleichenias,
    the type of stelar anatomy illustrated by <i>Gleichenia
    dicarpa</i> (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, C, p. 310) and other species is characteristic
    of the primary structure of the stem of the Pteridosperm
    <i>Heterangium</i>. We find in Carboniferous types undoubted
    indications of anatomical and other features which in succeeding
    ages became the marks of Gleicheniaceae.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

  <p>Some Carboniferous fronds with short and small pinnules of
    the <i>Pecopteris</i> type, bearing sori composed of a small number of
    sporangia, have been assigned by Grand’Eury and other authors
    to the Gleicheniaceae; the same form of sorus is met with
    also on fronds with Sphenopteroid segments. The former is
    illustrated by <i>Oligocarpia Gutbieri</i><a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> and the latter by <i>O. Brongniarti</i>
    described by Stur and by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. Zeiller has described
    the circular sori of <i>Oligocarpia</i> (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, B) as consisting of
    three to ten pyriform sporangia borne at the ends of lateral
    veins and possessing a complete transverse annulus, but Stur<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>
    believes that the annulus-like appearance is due to the manner
    of preservation of exannulate sporangia. In this opinion Stur
    is supported by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> and by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>. Despite
    an agreement between <i>Oligocarpia</i> and <i>Gleichenia</i>, as regards
    the form of the sori and the number of sporangia, it is not
    certain that the existence of a typical Gleicheniaceous annulus
    has been proved to occur in any Palaeozoic sporangia<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>.</p>

  <p>From Upper Triassic beds of Virginia, Fontaine has figured
    several fronds for which he instituted the genus <i>Mertensides</i><a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>.
    The habit, as he points out, is not dichotomous, but the sori are
    circular and are said to be composed in some species of four to
    six sporangia. No satisfactory evidence is brought forward in
    support of the use of a designation implying a close relationship
    with recent Gleichenias (sect. <i>Mertensia</i>). One of the species
    described by Fontaine was originally named by Bunbury
    <i>Pecopteris bullatus</i><a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>, the imperfect type-specimen of which is
    now in the Museum of the Cambridge Botany School. In the
    form of the frond, the thick rachis, and in the pinnules this
    Triassic species resembles <i>Todites Williamsoni</i>, but the resemblance
    does not extend to the sori. Two of Fontaine’s species
    are recorded by Stur from Austria<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>, but he places them in the
    genus <i>Oligocarpia</i> and includes them in the Marattiaceae.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

  <p>Leuthardt<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> figures what appears to be a Gleicheniaceous
    fern from the Upper Triassic beds of Basel as <i>Gleichenites gracilis</i>
    (Heer) showing sori composed of five sporangia (<a href="#fig265">fig. 265</a>, C)
    with a horizontal annulus. A Rhaetic species <i>Gleichenites
    microphyllus</i> Schenk<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> from Franconia agrees in the form of its
    small rounded pinnules with <i>Gleichenia</i>, but no sporangia have
    so far been found.</p>

  <p>An impression of a frond from Jurassic rocks of northern
    Italy figured by Zigno as <i>Gleichenites elegans</i><a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> closely resembles
    in habit recent species of <i>Gleichenia</i>; though no sporangia have
    been found, the habit of the frond gives probability to Zigno’s
    determination.</p>

  <p>A Jurassic species from Poland, <i>Gleichenites Rostafinskii</i>,
    referred by Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> to <i>Gleichenia</i>, exhibits a close agreement
    in habit and in the form of the soral impressions to some
    recent species of <i>Gleichenia</i>.</p>

  <p>As we pass upwards to Wealden and more recent rocks it
    becomes clear that the Gleicheniaceae were prominent members
    of late Mesozoic floras in north Europe and reached as far north
    as Disco Island. In English Wealden beds portions of sterile
    fronds have been found which were assigned to a new genus
    <i>Leckenbya</i><a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>, but it is probable that these specimens would be
    more correctly referred to <i>Gleichenites</i>. Similarly fragments of
    Gleichenia-like pinnae with very small rounded pinnules occur in
    the Wealden rocks of Bernissart, Belgium<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>, in north Germany<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>,
    and elsewhere. Conclusive evidence has been obtained by
    Prof. Bommer of the existence of <i>Gleichenites</i> in Wealden beds
    near Brussels, where many plant remains have been found in a
    wonderful state of preservation. The specimens, which I had an
    opportunity of seeing some years ago, might easily be mistaken
    for rather old and brown pieces of recent plants. Some of the
    Belgian fragments, of which Prof. Bommer has kindly sent
    me drawings and photographs, are characterised by an arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
    of vascular tissue identical with that in the petioles and
    rhizomes of some protostelic Gleichenias. The stele of one of
    the Belgian rhizomes appears to be identical with that of
    <i>Gleichenia dicarpa</i> (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, C. p. 310).</p>

  <h6><i>Gleichenites Zippei</i> (Corda). Fig. 262, D.</h6>

  <p>This species, originally described by Corda as <i>Pecopteris
    Zippei</i><a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and afterwards figured by Heer<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> as <i>Gleichenia Zippei</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>(<a href="#fig262">fig. 262</a>, D) from Urgonian rocks of Greenland, affords a
    striking example of a Mesozoic member of the <i>Gleicheniaceae</i>.
    It is characterised by the dichotomous branching of the frond
    and by the occurrence of arrested buds in the forks. The long
    and slender pinnae, reaching a length of 9 cm. and a breadth of
    6–8 mm., bear small crowded pinnules occasionally with circular
    sori which are described by Heer as consisting of a small number
    of sporangia (cf. <a href="#fig262">fig. 262</a>, C). Several other Lower Cretaceous
    species are recorded by Heer from Greenland, some of which
    are probably unnecessarily separated from <i>Gleichenites Zippei</i>.
    Examples of these are represented in <a href="#fig262">fig. 262</a>, A, B, C.</p>

  <p>A Gleicheniaceous species described by Debey and Ettingshausen
    from Lower Cretaceous rocks of Aix-la-Chapelle as
    <i>Didymosorus comptonifolius</i><a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> is very similar in habit to some
    of Heer’s Greenland species: this should probably be referred
    to the genus <i>Gleichenites</i>.</p>

  <h6><i>Gleichenites hantonensis</i>, Wank. Fig. 263.</h6>

  <p>From the Eocene beds of Bournemouth, Gardner and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
    have described under the name <i>Gleichenia hantonensis</i>
    what is in all probability a true <i>Gleichenia</i> (<a href="#fig263">fig. 263</a>). This
    species, originally recorded by Wanklyn<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>, is characterised by a
    slender forked rachis showing what may be traces of arrested
    buds between the arms of the branches, by circular sori of
    six or eight sporangia and by the presence of peculiar tendril-like
    appendages on the pinnae. If the description of the
    tendrils is correct, this British species affords one of the few
    instances of ferns adapted for climbing and may be compared
    with the recent species <i>Davallia aculeata</i> (<a href="#fig232">fig. 232</a>, p. 299).</p>

  <h4 id="Matonineae_21">Matonineae.</h4>

  <p>The genera <i>Laccopteris</i> and <i>Matonidium</i> may be described

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

  <p><i>Laccopteris</i>. This genus, founded by Presl<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>, may be described
    as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond pedate, in habit resembling <i>Matonia pectinata</i>, with pinnate or
      pinnatifid pinnae; ultimate segments linear, provided with a well-marked
      midrib giving off numerous dichotomously branched secondary veins which
      are in places connected by lateral anastomoses. Sori circular, forming a
      single row on each side of the midrib (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, B); sporangia 5–15 in each
      sorus, with an oblique annulus and tetrahedral spores. The presence of
      an indusium is not certainly established.</p>

  <p>Schenk<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>, who described several specimens of <i>Laccopteris</i>
    from Rhaetic rocks of Germany, compared the genus with
    <i>Gleichenia</i> but he also recognised the close resemblance to

    identity of the sori and sporangia of <i>Laccopteris</i> and <i>Matonia</i>.
    The Rhaetic species, such as <i>L. Muensteri</i>, <i>L. elegans</i>, and <i>L.
      Goepperti</i>, agree very closely with <i>L. polypodioides</i> and need not
    be described in detail.</p>

  <p>The Rhaetic species <i>Laccopteris elegans</i>, represented in

    shows a feature usually overlooked<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>, namely the occurrence of
    anastomoses between the lateral veins. The form of the sorus

    An examination of Rhaetic specimens of <i>Laccopteris</i> in the

    the long petiole divides distally into several spreading
    pinnatifid pinnae with linear ultimate segments (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, A).
    Circular sori (indusiate?) occur in a single row on each side of
    the midrib containing 12–14 large sporangia (<a href="#fig266">fig. 266</a>) characterised
    by an obliquely vertical annulus. The midrib of the
    pinnules gives off secondary veins at a wide angle and these
    form a series of elongated meshes parallel to the median rib,
    as in the recent genus <i>Woodwardia</i>; forked and anastomosing
    branches are given off from these to the edge of the lamina

  <p>The specimen shown in <a href="#fig268">fig. 268</a> is probably a young frond of
    this species.</p>

  <p>A very similar, possibly a specifically identical plant, was

    Woodwardi</i><a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>, the distinguishing features of which are the
    greater number of lateral veins and the smaller sori (<a href="#fig267">fig. 267</a>, A).</p>

  <p>The name <i>Microdictyon</i> was proposed by Saporta<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> for pinnules
    differing slightly from those of <i>Laccopteris</i> in venation characters:
    he included <i>Laccopteris Woodwardi</i> in this genus, but such
    differences as are recognisable in the venation hardly justify the
    use of a distinct generic title. Similarly, specimens described by
    Debey and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> from Lower Cretaceous rocks of Aix-la-Chapelle

  <p>This species is represented in several Wealden localities by
    fragments of fertile pinnae similar to those of <i>L. polypodioides</i>.
    It is almost impossible to distinguish small specimens of the
    Wealden fern from Heer’s genus <i>Nathorstia</i> (Marattiaceae)
    unless the sori are well preserved. This species occurs in
    Wealden beds in England, Germany, Belgium, and elsewhere
    and has been discovered by Dr Marcus Gunn in Upper Jurassic
    plant-beds of Sutherlandshire (N.E. Scotland).</p>

  <p><i>Laccopteris</i> is widely spread in Rhaetic, Jurassic and Lower
    Cretaceous floras. It affords evidence of the former abundance
    in northern latitudes of a family now represented by the two
    species of <i>Matonia</i> confined to a restricted area in the southern
    hemisphere.</p>

  <h5><i>Matonidium.</i></h5>

  <p>Schenk<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> instituted this convenient term for fossil fern fronds
    agreeing in habit and in their sori with <i>Matonia pectinata</i> (figs.
    227, 228, p. 292). Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> has drawn attention to the fact that
    the Mesozoic species differ from the surviving types in the
    greater number of sporangia in each sorus, and, it may be added,
    in <i>Matonidium</i> the fertile pinnules are more richly supplied with
    sori than are those of <i>Matonia</i>. Unfortunately our knowledge
    of the structure of the sporangia of <i>Matonidium</i> is less complete
    than in the case of <i>Laccopteris</i>, but such evidence as is available
    justifies the conclusion that <i>Matonia</i> is a direct descendant of
    ferns which formed a prominent feature in European Jurassic
    and Wealden floras. It is interesting to find that in a Cretaceous
    species, described by Krasser (<a href="#fig265">fig. 265</a>, A) since the publication
    of Zeiller’s paper, the sori appear to be identical in distribution
    and in appearance with those of the recent species.</p>

  <p>I am indebted to Prof. Bommer for permission to reproduce
    the unpublished drawing represented in <a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a> D (p. 310) of a
    section of the rhizome of <i>Matonidium</i> from the Belgian Wealden
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>beds of Hainaut (“Flore Bernissartienne”). The section shows an
    arrangement of vascular tissue identical with that in the recent
    species: there may be two solenosteles and in addition a solid
    axial strand. The form of the leaf-trace in the fossil appears to
    be identical with that in <i>Matonia pectinata</i> (<a href="#fig237">fig. 237</a>, A, p. 310).</p>

  <h6><i>Matonidium Goepperti</i> (Ettingshausen)<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>. Fig. 269.</h6>

  <p>Under this name are included specimens from Inferior
    Oolite and Wealden strata in Britain and elsewhere. It is,
    however, not impossible that if more information were available,
    we should find adequate reasons for recognising two specific
    types. Fontaine<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>, adhering rigidly to the rules of priority,
    speaks of this species as <i>Matonidium Althausii</i> (Dunker), but
    Ettingshausen’s specific term is better known.</p>

  <p>The English examples have so far afforded no information
    in regard to sporangial structure, but Schenk<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> has recognised a
    distinct annulus in German material. In his description of fossil
    plants from Lower Cretaceous rocks in California, Fontaine<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>
    doubtfully identifies two very small fragments as <i>Matonidium
    Althausii</i>; the evidence is, however, wholly inadequate.</p>

  <h6><i>Matonidium Wiesneri</i>, Krasser<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. <a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>, A.</h6>

  <p>This Cenomanian (Cretaceous) species from Moravia appears
    to be identical in habit with the older type. The pinnules are
    larger and bear fewer sori. Krasser’s figures of the sterile pinnules
    show no lateral anastomosing between the secondary veins, but
    the small vascular network below each sorus (<a href="#fig265">fig. 265</a>, A) is
    identical with that in <i>Matonia pectinata</i>. The indusiate sori
    contain about six sporangia with an oblique annulus.</p>

  <p>The very wide geographical distribution of the Matonineae
    during the Mesozoic era affords a striking contrast to the
    limited range of the Malayan survivals.</p>

    designation of Palaeozoic ferns, more particularly in the older
    literature, is another instance of the undue importance which
    palaeobotanists have always been prone to attach to external
    resemblances of vegetative organs. The fragment of lamina
    described by Stur for the Culm Measures of Austria as <i>Hymenophyllum
    waldenburgense</i><a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> has no claim to consideration as
    evidence of Palaeozoic Hymenophyllaceae. On the other hand,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>there are a few records of fertile fronds which, though not to be
    accepted without reserve, are worthy of more careful examination.
    Some petrified sporangia described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> from
    the Culm of Esnost are referred to <i>Hymenophyllites</i> on account
    of the position of the annulus, which appears to encircle about
    two-thirds of the circumference; it is, however, not certain that
    the annulus is horizontal as in the recent genus.</p>

  <p>The Culm species <i>Rhodea patentissima</i> described by Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
    as <i>Hymenophyllites patentissima</i> and subsequently
    referred by Stur<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> to <i>Rhodea</i>, is regarded by these authors as
    closely allied to <i>Hymenophyllum</i> simply on the ground of the
    finely divided and delicate sterile fronds; another species, <i>Rhodea
    moravica</i> (Ett.), which Ettingshausen referred to <i>Trichomanes</i>,
    is compared with recent species of that genus. In neither
    case do we know anything of sporangial characters.</p>

  <p>A fertile sphenopteroid frond figured by Schimper as <i>Hymenophyllum
    Weissi</i><a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> from the Coal-Measures of Saarbrücken
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>bears some resemblance to recent Hymenophyllaceae, but the
    figures are by no means convincing: an examination of the
    type-specimens in the Strassburg Museum led Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
    to express dissent from Schimper’s determination. A more
    satisfactory example is that afforded by the fertile pieces of a
    frond described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> from French Coal-Measures as
    <i>Hymenophyllites quadridactylites</i> (Gutbier). Some of the
    ultimate segments with a truncated tip are preserved in close
    association with a group of oval sporangia with a complete
    transverse annulus (<a href="#fig270">fig. 270</a>, F, G). The position of the sporangia
    is such as to suggest their separation from a terminal columnar
    receptacle like that in <i>Trichomanes</i> and <i>Hymenophyllum</i>. In
    his account of this species from the Coal-Measures of the Forest
    of Wyre, Kidston<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> states that Zeiller informed him that he had
    noticed traces of what appeared to be a columnar receptacle in
    the French specimens.</p>

  <p>The records of Hymenophyllaceae from the Mesozoic and
    Tertiary formations are not such as need detain us. The facts
    bearing on the geological history of this family are singularly
    meagre. There is no evidence which can be adduced in
    favour of regarding the Hymenophyllaceae as ferns of great
    antiquity, which played a prominent part in the floras of
    the past.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to find that the genus <i>Ankyropteris</i><a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>, one
    of the Botryopterideae (a group of Palaeozoic Ferns for which I
    propose the name Coenopterideae), has a morphological character
    in common with <i>Trichomanes</i>, namely the production of axillary
    buds: there are also features in the stelar anatomy shared by
    the Botryopterideae and Hymenophyllaceae<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>. These resemblances,
    though by no means amounting to proof of near
    relationship, point to a remote ancestry for certain features
    retained by existing members of the Hymenophyllaceae.</p>

  <h4 id="Cyatheaceae_21">Cyatheaceae.</h4>

  <p>The specimens from the Culm rocks of Moravia on which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>Stur founded the species <i>Thyrsopteris schistorum</i><a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> are too imperfectly
    preserved to warrant the use of this generic name.
    Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> in 1836 instituted the genera <i>Cyatheites</i>, <i>Hemitelites</i>,
    and <i>Balantites</i> for species of Carboniferous ferns believed to be
    closely allied to recent Cyatheaceae, but a fuller knowledge
    of these types has clearly demonstrated that in all cases the
    reference to this family had no justification.</p>

  <p>The Upper Carboniferous species <i>Dicksonites Pluckeneti</i>, of
    which Sterzel<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> described fertile specimens in 1886 as possessing
    circular sori, has since been shown by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> to be a
    Pteridosperm bearing small seeds. In <i>Sphenopteris</i> (<i>Discopteris</i>)
    <i>cristata</i> (Brongn.) Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> has described sori very like those of
    <i>Cyathea</i> and <i>Alsophila</i>, but differing in the exannulate sporangia:
    this species, like so many of the Palaeozoic ferns, is probably more
    akin to the Marattiaceae than to the Cyatheaceae.</p>

  <p>We have as yet no satisfactory evidence of the existence of
    the Cyatheaceae in Palaeozoic floras. It is not until we reach
    the Jurassic period that trustworthy data are obtained. Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
    has identified as Cyatheaceous fertile Jurassic fronds
    from Poland, but his figures are inconclusive. In <i>Alsophila
    polonica</i> it is not clear whether the annulus is vertical or oblique,
    and in another supposed member of the family, <i>Gonatosorus
    Nathorsti</i>, in which the indusium is described as bivalvate,
    there is no proof of affinity to Cyatheaceae.</p>

  <p>In attempting to decipher the past history of the Cyatheaceae
    it is important to remember the close resemblance
    between the fertile segments of some species of <i>Davallia</i>
    (Polypodiaceae) and those of <i>Dicksonia</i> (<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>, C, D, p. 294).
    Unless the sporangia are well enough preserved to show the
    position of the annulus, it is frequently impossible to feel much
    confidence in the value of the grosser features, such as the
    reduced lamina of the fertile segments and the form of the
    sori. It is, however, probable that the widely-spread Jurassic
    species <i>Coniopteris hymenophylloides</i> is correctly referred to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>Cyatheaceae, but even in the case of this species the evidence
    of external form needs confirmation by an examination of
    individual sporangia.</p>

  <h5><i>Coniopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus was instituted by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> for fossil fronds
    characterised by pinnules more or less intermediate between
    the <i>Pecopteris</i> and <i>Sphenopteris</i> type and agreeing in the form
    of the sori with the leaves of recent species of <i>Dicksonia</i>. It
    should be noted that Stur included in this genus a species,
    <i>Coniopteris lunzensis</i><a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> from the Upper Trias of Lunz, which he
    regarded as a Marattiaceous fern.</p>

  <p>The above list represents a small selection of the names
    applied to Jurassic ferns from different localities which there
    are good grounds for regarding as referable to a single type<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond tripinnate; pinnae linear acuminate, attached to the rachis at a
      wide angle; the pinnules vary considerably in size and shape; in some the
      lamina is divided into a few broad and rounded lobes (<a href="#fig275">fig. 275</a>, B) while in
      others the leaflets are dissected into narrow linear segments. The sori are
      borne at the ends of veins; the fertile pinnules have a much reduced

  </div>

  <p>The pinna shown in <a href="#fig271">fig. 271</a> is the type-specimen of
    <i>Sphenopteris arguta</i> Lind. and Hutt. from the Yorkshire
    Inferior Oolite and is indistinguishable from the English
    examples on which Brongniart founded his species <i>S. hymenophylloides</i>.
    Fig. 272 shows a specimen from the York Museum
    illustrating the difference between the sterile and fertile pinnae.
    The resemblance of some fertile pinnae of <i>Coniopteris hymenophylloides</i>
    to those of <i>Thyrsopteris elegans</i> has led to a frequent
    use, without any solid justification, of the generic name of the
    Juan Fernandez fern for Jurassic and Wealden plants. It is not
    impossible that some of the fossils described by Heer from
    Jurassic rocks of Siberia<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> as species of <i>Thyrsopteris</i> are Cyatheaceous
    ferns, but it is impossible to say with certainty that
    they are generically identical with the recent species. In his
    monograph of the Potomac flora of Virginia<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> and Maryland,
    Fontaine has described as species of <i>Thyrsopteris</i> several specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
    of fronds which afford no evidence as to the nature of the
    sori or sporangia. Some of the fronds referred by this author
    to <i>Thyrsopteris rarinervis</i><a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>, which I examined in the Washington
    Museum, are in all probability examples of <i>Onychiopsis</i>, a genus
    included in the Polypodiaceae. The fragments described by
    Lester Ward<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> as species of <i>Thyrsopteris</i> from the Lower
    Cretaceous of the Black Hills of North America afford no
    satisfactory evidence of relationship to the recent type. Similarly
    Velenovský has described a Lower Cretaceous <i>Onychiopsis</i> from
    Bohemia<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> as a species of <i>Thyrsopteris</i>, although the fertile
    segments bear little or no resemblance to those of the Cyatheaceous
    genus. Some fertile portions of fronds described by
    Heer<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> as <i>Asplenium Johnstrupi</i> and afterwards as <i>Dicksonia
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>Johnstrupi</i><a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> from the Cretaceous beds (Kome series) of Greenland
    are very similar to <i>Coniopteris hymenophylloides</i>.</p>

  <h6><i>Coniopteris quinqueloba</i> (Phillips). Fig. 273.</h6>

  <p>This species, originally described by Phillips<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> as <i>Sphenopteris
    quinqueloba</i>, is very similar in habit to <i>C. hymenophylloides</i>,
    differing chiefly in the smaller size of the leaf and in the
    narrower ultimate segments. The specimen shown in <a href="#fig273">fig. 273</a>, B,
    illustrates the form of the sorus and sporangia.</p>

  <p>The sterile pinnae of this species bear pinnules of a type
    met with in various species of ferns from different horizons;
    the smaller ones are entire and slightly falcate, while on the
    lower part of a frond the ultimate segments are longer and
    have a crenulate margin. The fertile pinnae bear pinnules
    reduced to a midrib with a narrow border, and terminating
    in a cup-like indusium (<a href="#fig275">fig. 275</a>, A). In habit the sterile leaf
    (<a href="#fig274">fig. 274</a>) of this species is similar to the Jurassic Schizaeaceous
    fern <i>Klukia exilis</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Protopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>Presl<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> instituted this genus for a Lower Cretaceous tree-fern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
    from Bohemia originally figured as <i>Lepidodendron punctatum</i><a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
    and assigned to a Palaeozoic horizon; it was afterwards
    named by Corda<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> <i>Protopteris Sternbergii</i> and referred by
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> to <i>Sigillaria</i>. The genus <i>Protopteris</i> stands for
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>fossil fern-stems with the habit and, in the main, the structural
    features of recent tree-ferns. Persistent leaf-bases and sinuous
    adventitious roots cover the surface of the stems: the vascular
    system is of the dictyostelic type characteristic of <i>Cyathea</i>
    (<a href="#fig240">fig. 240</a>, p. 313) and <i>Alsophila</i>. It is by the pattern formed by
    the vascular tissue on the exposed surface of the leaf-bases that
    <i>Protopteris</i> is most readily recognised: the leaf-trace has a horse-shoe
    form with the ends curled inwards and the sides more or
    less indented (<a href="#fig277">fig. 277</a>). The generic name <i>Caulopteris</i> is
    used by some authors in preference to Presl’s genus; but
    <i>Protopteris</i> is more conveniently restricted to Mesozoic Cyatheaceous
    stems and <i>Caulopteris</i> to Palaeozoic stems, with the
    internal structure of <i>Psaronius</i> (see Chap. <span class="allsmcap">XXIII.</span>). Stenzel
    applies <i>Caulopteris</i> to Mesozoic stems in which the leaf-trace
    consists of several separate strands and not of a continuous band.</p>

  <p>Lower Cretaceous casts of tree-fern stems in the Prague
    Museum have been described under the names <i>Alsophilina</i> and
    <i>Oncopteris</i>; the figures of the latter (<a href="#fig276">fig. 276</a>) given by Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>

    two separate strands in the form of two <span class="sans"><b>V</b></span>s lying on their sides.</p>

  <p>Tree-fern stems described under various generic names are
    not infrequently found in European Lower Cretaceous rocks: their
    comparative abundance affords an example of striking changes
    in geographical distribution since the latter part of the Mesozoic
    epoch. The Cyatheaceae no longer exist in Europe and the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>arborescent species of the genus have retreated to more southern

  <p>The earliest information in regard to the anatomy of this
    widely spread Lower Cretaceous fern we owe to Corda, who
    showed that the species agrees in essentials with existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
    tree-ferns. The English example described by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
    from Upper Greensand beds in Dorsetshire (now in the British

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>(14 cm. in diameter), of which a portion is seen in <a href="#fig277">fig. 277</a>, was
    described by Heer from Disco Island (Greenland) as a Carboniferous
    species<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>, but afterwards correctly assigned to the Cenomanian
    series<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> This species is recorded also from the Lower
    Cretaceous of Bohemia by Frič and Bayer<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Among examples
    of petrified stems exhibiting a general agreement with <i>Protopteris
    punctata</i> are those described by Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> from Turonian
    rocks in Germany. In one of these, <i>Rhizodendron oppoliense</i>
    Göpp., attention is drawn to branches given off from the stem
    stele which have a solenostelic structure in contrast to the

  <h4 id="Polypodiaceae2">Polypodiaceae.</h4>

  <p>Sections of petrified sporangia from the English Coal-Measures
    (<i>Pteridotheca</i> sp.) occasionally exhibit a striking
    resemblance to those of recent Polypodiaceae<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>, but in the
    absence of material in which it is possible to recognise the
    true orientation of the sporangia, the exact position of the
    annulus is almost impossible to determine. We have as yet
    no satisfactory evidence of the existence of true Polypodiaceae
    in the Palaeozoic era. It is noteworthy that apart from the
    absence of ferns which can reasonably be included in this family,
    the anatomical features of the Botryopterideae (Coenopterideae)
    and of the Cycadofilices or Pteridosperms do not foreshadow those
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>of Polypodiaceous ferns. On the other hand, as we have already
    noticed, anatomical characters of such families as the Gleicheniaceae,
    Hymenophyllaceae, and Schizaeaceae are met with in
    certain generalised Palaeozoic types. These facts are perhaps
    of some importance as supplying collateral evidence in favour of
    the relatively more recent origin of the dominant family of
    ferns in modern floras.</p>

  <p>The use of the generic name <i>Adiantites</i> for fern-like
    fronds of Lower Carboniferous age characterised by cuneate
    pinnules like those of species of <i>Adiantum</i>, suggests an affinity
    which is in all probability non-existent. It has been pointed
    out that this generic name was applied in the first instance to
    the leaves of the Jurassic plant <i>Ginkgo digitata</i><a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and should,
    therefore, be discarded. Schimper<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> used the designation
    <i>Adiantides</i>, and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>, more rashly than wisely, preferred
    <i>Adiantum</i>. The specimens described by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span><i>Adiantides antiquus</i> (Ett.) (<a href="#fig279">fig. 279</a>, A) from the Carboniferous
    limestone of Flintshire are portions of tripinnate fronds bearing
    cuneate segments with numerous forked veins radiating from the
    contracted base of the lamina. It is not improbable, in view of
    Dr White’s<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> discovery of seeds on a very similar plant from the
    Pottsville beds of North America, that this characteristic Lower
    Carboniferous genus is a Pteridosperm.</p>

  <p>From Jurassic rocks in various parts of the world numerous
    fossils have been described under the generic names <i>Aspidium</i>,
    <i>Asplenium</i>, <i>Davallia</i>, <i>Polypodium</i>, and <i>Pteris</i>. In the great
    majority of cases such records leave much to be desired from
    the point of view of students who appreciate the dangers of
    relying on external similarity between vegetative organs, and
    on resemblances founded on obscure impressions of sori. The
    generic term <i>Woodwardites</i><a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>, which suggests affinity with the
    recent genus <i>Woodwardia</i>, has been used for Rhaetic plants
    belonging to the Dipteridinae.</p>

  <p>A plant described as <i>Adiantides Lindsayoides</i> from Jurassic
    rocks of Victoria<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>, characterised by marginal sori which appear
    to be protected by the folded-over edge of the leaflets, and by
    the resemblance of the pinnules to those of recent species of
    <i>Lindsaya</i>, may be a true Polypodiaceous fern; but in this case,
    as in many similar instances, nothing is known of the structure
    of the sporangia. Some sterile pinnae described by Yabe from
    Jurassic rocks of Korea as <i>Adiantites Sewardi</i><a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> may perhaps be
    identical with the Australian species.</p>

  <p>In such a species as <i>Polypodium oregonense</i> Font., from
    Jurassic rocks of Oregon, the generic name is chosen because
    the “fructification seems near enough to that of <i>Polypodium</i> to
    justify the placing of the plant in that genus<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>.” But the fact
    that no sporangia have been found is a fatal objection to this
    identification.</p>

  <h5><i>Onychiopsis.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name was instituted by Yokoyama<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> for a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>Japanese Wealden species, previously described by Geyler<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> as
    <i>Thyrsopteris elongata</i>, on the ground that, in addition to a
    similarity in habit of the sterile fronds, the fertile pinnae
    present a close agreement to those of the recent genus
    <i>Onychium</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Onychiopsis Mantelli</i><a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> (Brongn.). Figs. <a href="#fig278">278</a>, D; <a href="#fig280">280</a>, A and B.</h5>

  <p>The Japanese species <i>Onychiopsis elongata</i> may perhaps be
    identical with this common Wealden fern which, as Fontaine
    points out, should be called <i>O. psilotoides</i> if the rule of priority
    is to be observed irrespective of long usage.</p>

  <p><i>Onychiopsis Mantelli</i> may be defined as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond bipinnate, ovate lanceolate, rachis winged; pinnae approximate,
      given off at an acute angle; pinnules narrow, acuminate, with a single
      vein; the larger segments serrate and gradually passing into pinnae with
      narrow ultimate segments. Fertile segments sessile or shortly stalked,
      linear ovate, sometimes terminating in a short awn-like prolongation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The fertile segments (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, D) bear so close a resemblance
    to those of species of <i>Onychium</i> that it would seem justifiable
    to regard the plant as a member of the Polypodiaceae. This
    fern is one of the most characteristic members of the Wealden
    floras; it occurs in abundance in the English Wealden, in
    Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Japan, Bohemia, South Africa,
    and elsewhere. A piece of rhizome figured from the English
    Wealden<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> is very similar to the creeping rhizomes of recent
    species of Polypodiaceae. The English Wealden specimens
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>shown in <a href="#fig280">fig. 280</a>, A and B, illustrate the difference in form
    presented by leaves of this species; the smaller pinnae reproduced
    in fig. A are more characteristic of the species than are
    those of the slightly enlarged example represented in <a href="#fig280">fig. 280</a>, B.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Among British Tertiary species referred to Polypodiaceae,
    it is interesting to find what may well be an authentic record
    of a fern closely allied to the recent tropical species <i>Acrostichum</i>
    (<i>Chrysodium</i>) <i>aureum</i>. This Eocene species from Bournemouth
    is described as <i>Chrysodium lanzaeanum</i><a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>. The frond is simply
    pinnate and apparently coriaceous in texture, with lanceolate or
    oblong lanceolate pinnules (<a href="#fig261">fig. 261</a>, A, A′, p. 350), differing from
    those of <i>Acrostichum aureum</i> in being sessile. A prominent
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>midrib gives off numerous anastomosing veins. No fertile
    pinnules have been found.</p>

  <p>Specimens described by Forbes from the Eocene beds of the
    Island of Mull as <i>Onoclea hebraidica</i><a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> bear a strong likeness
    to the North American and Japanese recent species <i>Onoclea
    sensibilis</i>. Fertile specimens referred to the latter species are
    recorded by Knowlton<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> from Tertiary beds of Montana.</p>

  <p>A species described by Saporta<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> from the Eocene of
    Sézanne as <i>Adiantum apalophyllum</i> is recorded by Gardner
    and Ettingshausen from Bournemouth; an identification which
    is based on somewhat meagre evidence.</p>

  <p>The following remarks by Gardner and Ettingshausen are
    worthy of repetition as calling attention to circumstances often
    overlooked in analyses of fossil floras. They speak of ferns as
    relatively rare in British Eocene rocks and add,—“the floras
    consist principally of deciduous dicotyledonous leaves, which ...
    fell into the water and were tranquilly silted over. Ferns, on
    the other hand, would require some violence to remove them
    from the place of their growth, and their preservation would
    consequently be exceptional, and they would be mutilated and
    fragmentary. This may account for their rarity. Few as the
    British ferns are in the number of species, they nevertheless
    form the largest and most important series of Eocene ferns,
    even of Tertiary ferns, yet described from one group of beds<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>.”</p>

  <h4 id="#Dipteridinae_21">Dipteridinae.</h4>

  <h5><i>Dictyophyllum.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus was founded by Lindley and Hutton for a
    pinnatifid leaf from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire which they
    regarded as probably dicotyledonous and named <i>D. rugosum</i><a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>.
    Several ferns of this genus have since been found with well-preserved
    sori which demonstrate a close similarity to the recent
    fern <i>Dipteris.</i> <i>Dictyophyllum</i> may be defined as follows:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

  <p>Fronds large and palmate, characterised by the equal dichotomy of the
    main rachis into two arms which curve outwards and then bend inwards
    (<a href="#fig281">fig. 281</a>); from the surface of each arm are given off numerous spreading
    pinnae with a lamina more or less deeply dissected into lobes varying in
    breadth and in the form of the apex. Each lobe has a median vein, from
    which branches are given off approximately at right angles and then subdivide
    into a reticulum, in the meshes of which the veinlets end blindly
    (<a href="#fig282">fig. 282</a>, A and E). Sori composed of annulate sporangia are crowded on the
    lower surface of the lamina. In habit and in sporangial characters the
    genus closely resembles <i>Dipteris</i>, and in the branching of the frond
    suggests comparison with <i>Matonia</i>. The rhizome (<i>Rhizomopteris</i>) is
    creeping and dichotomously branched, bearing leaf-scars with a horse-shoe
    form of vascular strand.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Dictyophyllum</i> is represented by several types to which
    various specific names have been assigned, the distinguishing
    features being the form of the pinna lobes, the degree of concrescence
    between the basal portions of the pinnae, and similar
    features which in some cases can only be safely used as criteria
    when large specimens are available for comparison.</p>

  <p>The restoration, after Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>, shown in <a href="#fig281">fig. 281</a> illustrates
    the habit of this striking fern, examples of which or of closely
    allied species are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of Germany, Scania,
    Persia, Bornholm, Tonkin, China, and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>. The petiole,
    reaching a length of 60 cm., forks at the apex into two equal
    arms leaving between them an oval space and occasionally
    crossing one another. The axes of these branches are twisted
    so that the pinnae, which may be as many as 24 on each arm,
    and arise from the inner side, by torsion of the axes assume an
    external position. An interesting analogy as regards the
    twisted rachis of <i>Dictyophyllum exile</i> and <i>Camptopteris</i> is
    afforded by the leaves of the Cycads, <i>Macrozamia Fawcettiae</i> and
    <i>M. corallipes</i>, which are also characterised by the torsion of
    the rachis. The habit, justly compared by Nathorst with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>that of <i>Matonia pectinata</i>, affords another illustration of the
    common occurrence in older ferns of a dichotomous system
    of branching. The pinnae, characterised by circinate vernation,
    reach a length of 60 cm. and are divided into linear lobes
    inclined obliquely or at right angles to the pinna axis. The
    whole of the under surface of the lamina may be covered with
    sporangia, 4–7 sporangia in each sorus; the annulus is
    incomplete and approximately vertical (<a href="#fig282">fig. 282</a>, D). The
    rhizome is probably represented by the dichotomously branched
    axis described by Nathorst from Scania as <i>Rhizomopteris
    major</i>; the leaf-scars show a horse-shoe leaf-trace.</p>

  <p>This type, represented by a splendid series of specimens
    from the Rhaetic beds of Tonkin, agrees very closely with
    <i>D. exile</i>. It differs, however, in the basal parts of the pinnae
    which are concrescent for a length of 5 to 8 cm. instead of free as
    in <i>D. exile</i>; and, to a slight degree, in the form of the ultimate
    segments. In habit and in soral characters the two species are
    practically identical. Each sorus contains 5 to 8 sporangia,
    which are rather larger than those of <i>Dipteris</i>.</p>

  <p>This species, which is characteristic of Jurassic rocks, is
    less completely known than the two types described above,
    but in the form and venation of the pinnae there is little
    difference between the Rhaetic and Jurassic plants. The leaves
    of the Jurassic species appear to have been smaller and more
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>like those of <i>Dipteris conjugata</i> (<a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>); there are no indications

    lunzensis</i> Stur<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>, an Austrian Upper Triassic species, the
    pinnae are entire. In <i>Dictyophyllum</i> the sori cover the whole
    lower surface of the leaf; in <i>Dipteris</i> they are more widely
    separated and the sporangia have a diameter of 0·02 mm., but
    in <i>Dictyophyllum</i> the diameter is 0·4–0·6 mm. Moreover in
    <i>Dictyophyllum</i> the sori contain 5 to 8 sporangia, whereas in
    <i>Dipteris</i> they are much more numerous. Despite these differences
    it is clear, as Nathorst says, that <i>Dictyophyllum</i>,
    <i>Clathropteris</i>, and <i>Camptopteris</i> are existing types very closely
    allied to <i>Dipteris</i>. It is a matter of secondary importance
    whether we include all in the Dipteridinae or follow Nathorst’s
    suggestion and refer the fossil genera to the separate family
    Camptopteridinae.</p>

  <h5><i>Thaumatopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus, founded by Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> for a Rhaetic plant
    from Bayreuth, is by some authors<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> regarded as identical
    with <i>Dictyophyllum</i>, but it has recently been resuscitated by
    Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> for specimens which he names <i>T. Schenki</i>, formerly
    included by Schenk in his species <i>T. Brauniana</i><a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>. It bears
    a close resemblance, in the long linear pinnules with an entire
    or crenulate margin, to <i>Dictyophyllum Fuchsi</i> described by
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> from Tonkin, and it would seem hardly necessary to
    adopt a distinctive generic designation. The sporangia have
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>a vertical or slightly oblique annulus and the rhizome is
    similar to that of <i>Dictyophyllum exile</i>. The habit of the
    genus is shown in <a href="#fig284">fig. 284</a>, which represents one of the
    German Rhaetic species.</p>

  <h5><i>Clathropteris.</i></h5>

  <h6><i>Clathropteris meniscoides</i>, Brongn. Fig. 285.</h6>

  <p><i>Clathropteris</i>, founded by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> for Rhaetic specimens
    from Scania, agrees very closely with some species of <i>Dictyophyllum</i>,
    but in view of the more rectangular form of the
    venation-meshes it is convenient to retain both names. The
    type-species was originally named <i>Filicites meniscoides</i><a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> and
    afterwards transferred to <i>Clathropteris</i>. An examination of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>Brongniart’s specimens has convinced Nathorst of the specific
    identity of <i>C. meniscoides</i> and <i>C. platyphylla</i>. The Tonkin
    leaves described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> under the latter name should,
    therefore, be included in <i>C. meniscoides</i>, which may be thus
    defined:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The petiolate frond is characterised by an equal dichotomy of the
      rachis, as in <i>Dictyophyllum</i>; each branch bore 5–15 pinnae, disposed
      <i>en éventail</i>, reaching a length of 20–30 cm. and fused basally as in
      <i>D. Nathorsti</i> Zeill. Pinnae linear lanceolate, slightly contracted at the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>lower end and gradually tapered distally. The lamina, 3–14 cm. broad,
      is characterised by obtusely pointed marginal lobes. From the midrib
      of each pinna lateral veins are given off at a wide angle, and adjacent
      veins are connected by a series of branches which divide the lamina
      into a regular reticulum of rectangular and polygonal meshes (<a href="#fig285">fig. 285</a>).
      The sori are abundant and contain 5–12 sporangia like those of <i>Dictyophyllum</i>.

  <p>What is probably the rhizome of this species has been
    described by Nathorst (<i>Rhizomopteris cruciata</i>); it is similar
    to that of <i>Dictyophyllum</i>, but the leaf-scars are more widely
    separated. This species occurs in Upper Triassic, Rhaetic or
    Lower Jurassic rocks of Scania, France, Germany, Switzerland,
    Bornholm, North America, China, Tonkin, and Persia and is
    represented by fragments in the Rhaetic beds of Bristol<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>.</p>

  <p>The specimen on which this species was founded was discovered
    in the Nubian Sandstone east of Edfu; the age of the
    beds is uncertain, but the presence of <i>Clathropteris</i> suggests a
    Lower Jurassic or Rhaetic horizon<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>. Seven strong ribs radiate
    through the lamina from the summit of the petiole; at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
    small pieces of the projecting ribs are shown in the grooves.
    From the main veins slender branches are given off at right
    angles and, as seen in the enlarged drawing, these again subdivide

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>resembling those of <i>Clathropteris</i> and <i>Dictyophyllum</i>, but differing
    in the form of the pinnae and in habit. The habit of the
    type-species, <i>C. spiralis</i>, is shown in <a href="#fig287">fig. 287</a>. An examination
    of the specimens in the Stockholm Museum convinced me of
    the correctness of Nathorst’s restoration<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>. Each of the forked
    arms of the rachis bore as many as 150–160 long and narrow
    pinnae characterised by an anastomosing venation (<a href="#fig282">fig. 282</a>, C)
    and by a spiral disposition due to the torsion of the axes. The
    sporangia agree in essentials with those of <i>Dictyophyllum</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Hausmannia.</i></h5>

  <p>A critical and exhaustive account of this genus has been
    given by Prof. Von Richter<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> based on an examination of
    specimens found in the Lower Cretaceous rocks of Quedlinburg
    in Germany. The name was proposed by Dunker<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> for leaves
    from the Wealden of Germany characterised by a deeply dissected
    dichotomously branched lamina. Andrae subsequently instituted
    the genus <i>Protorhipis</i><a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> for suborbicular leaves with dichotomously
    branched ribs from the Lias of Steierdorf. A similar
    but smaller type of leaf was afterwards described by Zigno<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
    from Jurassic beds of Italy as <i>P. asarifolius</i>, and Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>
    figured a closely allied form from Rhaetic rocks of Sweden.
    While some authors regarded <i>Hausmannia</i> and <i>Protorhipis</i> as
    ferns, others compared them with the leaves of <i>Baiera</i> (Ginkgoales);
    Saporta suggested a dicotyledonous affinity for
    leaves of the <i>Protorhipis</i> type. The true nature of the
    fossils was recognised by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>, who called attention to the
    very close resemblance in habit and in soral characters to the
    recent genus <i>Dipteris</i>. A comparison of the different species
    of <i>Dipteris</i>, including young leaves (<a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>, p. 297), with those
    of the fossil species reveals a very striking agreement<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>. There
    can be no doubt, as Richter points out, that the names <i>Hausmannia</i>
    and <i>Protorhipis</i> stand for one generic type.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

  <p><i>Hausmannia</i> may be defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Rhizome creeping, slender, dichotomously branched; leaf-stalks slender
      (2–25 cm. long), bearing a leathery lamina (1–12 cm. long and broad),
      wedge-shaped below, occasionally cordate or reniform, entire or more or
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>less deeply lobed into broad linear segments. The leaf is characterised by
      dichotomously branched main ribs which arise from the summit of the
      rachis as two divergent arms and radiate in a palmate manner, with
      repeated forking, through the lamina. Lateral veins are given off at a
      wide angle, and, by subdivision, form a fairly regular network similar to
      that in <i>Dictyophyllum</i>, <i>Clathropteris</i>, and <i>Dipteris</i>.

  <h6><i>Hausmannia dichotoma</i>, Dunker<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>. Fig. 288, A, B.</h6>

  <p>This Wealden species, represented in the North German
    flora and in beds of approximately the same age at Quedlinburg,
    has been discovered by Dr Marcus Gunn in Upper
    Jurassic rocks on the north-east coast of Scotland. The lamina
    (12 cm. or more in length) is divided into five to seven linear
    segments and bears a close superficial resemblance to leaves
    of <i>Baiera</i> and to recent species of <i>Schizaea</i> (<a href="#fig222">fig. 222</a>, p. 287).
    Each segment contains one or two main ribs (<a href="#fig288">fig. 288</a>, A). A
    similar form is described by Bartholin<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> and by Moeller<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> as
    <i>H. Forchammeri</i> from Jurassic rocks of Bornholm.</p>

  <h6><i>Hausmannia Kohlmanni</i>, Richt. Fig. 278, F.</h6>

  <p>In this species, instituted by Richter from material obtained
    from the Lower Cretaceous beds of Strohberg<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>, the comparatively
    slender rhizome bears fronds with petioles reaching a
    length in extreme cases of 25 cm. but usually of about
    10 cm. The lamina (1–7 cm. long and 1–10 cm. broad) is
    described as leathery, obcordate, and divided into two symmetrical
    halves by a median sinus which, though occasionally
    extending more than half-way through the lamina, is usually
    shallow. The venation consists of two main branches which
    diverge from the summit of the petiole (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, F) and subdivide
    into dichotomously branched ribs; finer veins (not shown
    in the drawing) are given off from these at right angles and
    form more or less rectangular meshes as in other members of
    the Dipteridinae and in such recent ferns as <i>Polypodium
    quercifolium</i> (<a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>, D, p. 297).</p>

  <p>The imperfect lamina represented in <a href="#fig289">fig. 289</a> may belong to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span><i>Hausmannia Richteri</i> or may be a distinct species; it shows
    some of the finer veins connecting the shorter forked ribs,
    which formed part of the reticulate ramifying system in the
    mesophyll. This specimen was obtained from the plant-beds of
    Culgower on the Sutherlandshire coast, which have been placed
    by some geologists in the Kimmeridgian series.</p>

  <p>The smaller type represented in <a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, E, is referred by
    Richter to a distinct species, <i>Hausmannia Sewardi</i><a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>, founded
    on a few specimens from the Lower Cretaceous strata of
    Strohberg. This species is characterised by a stouter rhizome
    bearing smaller leaves consisting of a short petiole (3–4 cm.
    long) and an obovate lamina (1–2 cm. long and broad). There
    are usually two opposite leaflets on each leaf-stalk, and these
    may be equivalent to the two halves of a single deeply dissected
    lamina.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to compare these different forms of <i>Hausmannia</i>
    with the fronds of recent species of <i>Dipteris</i> represented
    in <a href="#fig231">fig. 231</a>. The more deeply dissected type, such as <i>H. dichotoma</i>,
    closely resembles <i>D. Lobbiana</i> or <i>D. quinquefurcata</i>,
    while the more or less entire fossil leaves (<a href="#fig278">fig. 278</a>, E, F and
    <a href="#fig289">fig. 289</a>) are very like the somewhat unusual form of <i>Dipteris

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

    described a small Rhaetic species from Scania: a French
    Permian plant described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> and compared by him with
    <i>H. dichotoma</i>, may be a Palaeozoic example of this Dipteris-like
    genus.</p>

    Bagshot) of Bournemouth, and now in the British Museum,

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> discovery of Pteridosperms has necessarily led to a considerable
    modification of the views formerly held that existing
    genera of Marattiaceae represent survivors of a group which
    occupied a dominant position in the forests of the Coal age.
    Mr Arber writes:—“The evidence, formerly regarded as beyond
    suspicion, that the eusporangiate ferns formed a dominant
    feature of the vegetation of the Palaeozoic period, has been
    undermined, more especially by the remarkable discovery of
    the male organs of <i>Lyginodendron</i> by Mr Kidston. At best
    we can only now regard them as a subsidiary group in that
    epoch in the past history of the vegetable kingdom<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>.” Dr Scott
    expresses himself in terms slightly more favourable to the view
    that the Marattiaceae represent the aristocracy among the
    Filicales. He says:—“We now have to seek laboriously for
    evidence, which formerly seemed to lie open to us on all hands.
    I believe, however, that such careful investigation will result in
    the resuscitation of the Palaeozoic ferns as a considerable, though
    not as a dominant group<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>.” Zeiller’s faith<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> in the prospect of
    Marattiaceous ferns retaining their position as prominent
    members of Palaeozoic floras, though shaken, is not extinguished:
    he recognises that they played a subordinate part.</p>

  <p>Reference has already been made to the impossibility of
    determining whether Palaeozoic fern-like fronds may be legitimately
    retained in the Filicales, or whether they must be
    removed into the ever widening territory of the Pteridosperms.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>The difficulty is that the evidence of reproductive organs is
    very far from decisive. In the absence of the female reproductive
    organs, the seeds, we cannot in most cases be certain
    whether the small sporangium-like bodies on fertile pinnules
    are true fern sporangia or the microsporangia of a heterosporous
    pteridosperm. What is usually called an exannulate fern
    sporangium, such as we have in <i>Angiopteris</i> and in many
    Palaeozoic plants, has no distinguishing features which can
    be used as a decisive test. The microsporophylls of the
    Mesozoic Bennettitales produced their spores in sporangial
    compartments grouped in synangia like those of recent Marattiaceae;
    and in the case of <i>Crossotheca</i>, a type of frond
    always regarded as Marattiaceous until Kidston<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> proved it to
    be the microsporophyll of <i>Lyginodendron</i>, we have a striking
    instance of the futility of making dogmatic assertions as to
    the filicinean nature of what look like true fern sporangia. In
    all probability Dr Kidston’s surmise that the supposed fern
    sporangia known as <i>Dactylotheca</i>, <i>Renaultia</i>, <i>Urnatopteris</i> are
    the microsporangia of Pteridosperms will be proved correct<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>.
    The question is how many of the supposed Marattiaceous sporangia
    must be assigned to Pteridosperms? There is, however,
    no reasonable doubt that true Marattiaceae formed a part of
    the Upper Carboniferous flora. All that can be attempted in
    the following pages is to describe briefly some of the numerous
    types of sporangia recognised on Palaeozoic fern-like foliage,
    leaving to the future the task of deciding how many of them
    can be accepted as those of ferns. It is impossible to avoid
    overlapping and some repetition in the sections dealing with
    true Ferns and with Pteridosperms. The filicinean nature of
    the stem known as <i>Psaronius</i> (see <a href="#Page_415">page 415</a>) has not as yet
    been questioned.</p>

  <p>The nomenclature of supposed Marattiaceous species from
    Carboniferous and Permian rocks is in a state of some confusion
    owing to a lack of satisfactory distinguishing features between
    certain types to which different generic names have been
    assigned. As we have already seen in the case of supposed
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>leptosporangiate sporangia, the interpretation of structural
    features in petrified or carbonised sporangia does not afford
    an example of unanimity among palaeobotanical experts.</p>

  <h5 id="Ptychocarpus"><i>Ptychocarpus.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name, proposed by the late Professor Weiss<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>,
    is applied to a type of fructification illustrated by the plant
    which Brongniart named <i>Pecopteris unita</i>, a species common in
    the Upper Coal-Measures of England<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>. It is adopted by Kidston
    for fertile specimens from Radstock which he describes as
    <i>Ptychocarpus oblongus</i><a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>, but the precise nature of the fertile
    pinnules of this species cannot be determined.</p>

  <h6><i>Ptychocarpus unita</i> (Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>). Fig. 291, A, B. (= <i>Goniopteris
    unita</i>, Grand’Eury.)</h6>

  <p>This species has tripinnate fronds with linear pinnae bearing
    contiguous pinnules of the <i>Pecopteris</i> type (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>, B), 4–5 mm.
    long, confluent at the base or for the greater part of their length.
    On the under surface of the fertile segments, which are identical
    with the sterile, occur circular synangia (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>, A) consisting
    of seven sporangia embedded in a common parenchymatous
    tissue and radially disposed round a receptacle supplied with
    vascular tissue. The synangium is described as shortly stalked
    like those of <i>Marattia Kaulfussii</i> (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, B′, p. 320). In shape,
    in the complete union of the sporangia, and presumably in
    the apical dehiscence, <i>Ptychocarpus</i> agrees very closely with
    <i>Kaulfussia</i> (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>); but we cannot be certain that we have
    not a collection of microsporangia simulating a fern synangium.</p>

  <p>A synangium closely resembling <i>Ptychocarpus</i> has been
    described by Mr Watson<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> from the Lower Coal-Measures of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>Lancashire as <i>Cyathotrachus altus</i>, but there is no convincing
    evidence as to the nature of the plant on which it was borne.</p>

  <h5 id="Danaeites"><i>Danaeites.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name, instituted by Goeppert<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>, has been used
    by authors without due regard to the nature of the evidence
    of affinity to <i>Danaea</i>. The type named by Stur <i>Danaeites
    sarepontanus</i><a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>, E) bears small pecopteroid pinnules
    with ovoid sporangia in groups of 8–16 in two contiguous
    series on the lower face of the lamina. The sporangia dehisce
    by an apical pore and are more or less embedded in the
    mesophyll of the segments. No figures have been published
    showing any detailed sporangial structure, and such evidence

  <p>The plant described by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> from the Coal-fields of
    Gard and St Étienne, and made the type of a new genus, is
    characterised by pinnules intermediate between those of <i>Pecopteris</i>
    and <i>Neuropteris</i><a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> and by the presence of two rows of united
    sporangia along the lateral veins, as in <i>Danaea</i> and <i>Danaeites</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Asterotheca"><i>Asterotheca.</i></h5>

  <p>Certain species of <i>Pecopteris</i> fronds from Carboniferous strata
    are characterised by circular sori or synangia consisting of a
    small number (3–8) of exannulate sporangia attached to a
    central receptacle and free only at their apices. Strasburger<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>
    suggested a Marattiaceous affinity for <i>Asterotheca</i> and Stur<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
    describes the species <i>Asterotheca Sternbergii</i> Goepp. (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>,
    C, D) as an example of a Marattiaceous fern. The latter
    author retains Corda’s genus <i>Hawlea</i><a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> for the fertile fronds

  <h5 id="Hawlea"><i>Hawlea.</i></h5>

  <p>Stur<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> retains this generic name for sori in which the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>sporangia are free and united only by the proximal end to
    a central receptacle (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>, F, G). He describes the individual
    sporangia as possessing a rudimentary annulus, a
    comparatively strong wall, and terminating in a pointed distal
    end. He emphasises the greater degree of cohesion between
    the sporangia of <i>Asterotheca</i> as the distinguishing feature of
    that genus; but this is a character difficult to recognise in some
    cases, and from the analogy of recent ferns one is disposed to
    attach little importance to the greater or less extent to which
    sporangia are united, at least in such cases as <i>Asterotheca</i> and
    <i>Hawlea</i> when the cohesion is never complete.</p>

  <h5 id="Scolecopteris"><i>Scolecopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>Zenker<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> gave this name to detached fertile pinnules from
    the Lower Permian of Saxony, which he described as <i>Scolecopteris
    elegans</i>. He recognised the fern nature of the sori
    and suggested that the pinnules might belong to the fronds
    of one of the “Staarsteinen” (<i>Psaronius</i>), a view which subsequent
    investigations render far from improbable. The sori,
    which occur in two rows on the lower surface of the small
    pecopteroid segments with strongly revolute margins (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>,
    H–K), contain 4–5 sporangia attached to a stalked receptacle
    comparable with that of <i>Marattia Kaulfussii</i>. These pedicellate
    synangia were fully described by Strasburger<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>, who decided in
    favour of a Marattiaceous alliance. The lower portions of the
    distally tapered sporangia are concrescent, the distal ends being
    free (<a href="#fig291">fig. 291</a>, H). Stur includes in <i>Scolecopteris</i> the common
    species <i>Pecopteris arborescens</i> (<a href="#fig376">fig. 376</a>), but Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> states
    that the British example of <i>Scolecopteris</i> is <i>S. polymorpha</i>,
    Brongn. from the Upper Coal-Measures.</p>

  <p><i>Scolecopteris elegans</i> Zenk. furnishes an example of a plant,
    or plant fragment, which has been assigned to the animal
    kingdom. Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> described silicified pinnules as <i>Palaeojulus
    dyadicus</i>, the generic name being chosen because of the resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
    to Millipedes such as the genus <i>Julus</i>. The mistake
    is not surprising to anyone who has seen a block of siliceous
    rock from Chemnitz crowded with the small pinnules with
    their concave surfaces formed by the infolding of the edges.
    Sterzel<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>, who pointed out the confusion between Myriapods
    and Filices, has published figures which illustrate the deceptive
    resemblance of the pinnules, with their curved lamina divided
    by lateral veins into segments, to the body of a Millipede (fig.
    291, K). He points out that Geinitz searched in vain for the
    head and legs of <i>Palaeojulus</i> and expressed the hope that
    further examination would lead to fresh discoveries: the examination
    of sections revealed the presence of sporangia and
    demonstrated the identity of <i>Palaeojulus</i> and <i>Scolecopteris</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Discopteris"><i>Discopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>Stur<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> instituted this genus for fertile fronds from the Upper
    Carboniferous Schatzlarer beds, including two species <i>Discopteris
    karwinensis</i> and <i>D. Schumanni</i>. He described the small
    Sphenopteroid pinnules as characterised by disc-shaped sori
    made up of 70–100 sporangia attached to a hemispherical
    receptacle: the absence of a true annulus led him to refer the
    genus to the Marattiaceae. In his memoir on the coal-basin of
    Heraclea (Asia Minor), Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> instituted the species <i>Sphenopteris</i>
    (<i>Discopteris</i>) <i>Rallii</i> and figured sporangia resembling those
    described by Stur in the possession of a rudimentary “apical
    annulus.” He compared the sporangia with those of recent
    Osmundaceae and Marattiaceae. In the later memoir on the
    Upper Carboniferous and Permian plants of Blanzy and Creusot,
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> gives a very full and careful description of fertile
    specimens of <i>Sphenopteris</i> (<i>Discopteris</i>) <i>cristata</i>, a fern originally
    described by Brongniart as <i>Pecopteris cristata</i><a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>. Many of
    the Sphenopteroid pinnules of this quadripinnate fern frond
    show the form and structure of the sori with remarkable
    clearness in the admirable photographs reproduced in Plates
    <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>–<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> of Zeiller’s Blanzy memoir. The lobed pinnules of this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>species are of oval-triangular form, 5–15 mm. long and
    2·5–6 mm. broad<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>. An examination of the type-specimens
    of <i>Discopteris</i> from Vienna enabled Zeiller to correct Stur’s
    original description of the sori: he found that the Austrian
    and French specimens, though specifically distinct, undoubtedly
    belong to one genus. The sori in <i>Discopteris cristata</i> are
    globular, as in the recent genera <i>Cyathea</i> and <i>Alsophila</i>, and
    frequently cover the whole face of the lamina. The individual
    sporangia are 0·4–0·5 mm. long and 0·15–0·2 mm. in diameter;
    they are exannulate, but for the annulus is substituted a group
    of thicker-walled and larger cells in the apical and dorsal region.
    The description by Stur of a hemispherical receptacle seemed
    to indicate an important difference between the Austrian and
    French species; but Zeiller found that this feature does not
    actually exist and that it was so described as the result of
    misinterpretation. Zeiller succeeded in isolating spores, 40–50 μ
    in diameter, from some of the sporangia of <i>D. cristata</i> and
    found that they exhibited the three-rayed pattern characteristic
    of fern-spores and which is indicative of their formation in
    tetrads. The conclusion arrived at is that the genus <i>Discopteris</i>,
    as represented by <i>D. karwinensis</i>, <i>D. cristata</i> etc., may be
    regarded as a true fern and included in the Marattiaceae. As
    Zeiller points out, the sori of <i>Discopteris</i> differ from those of
    recent Marattiaceae in their pluriseriate construction and
    agree in this respect with those of the Cyatheaceae. The
    comparison already made<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> between the sporangia of <i>D. Rallii</i>
    and those of recent Osmundaceae holds good: the genus
    affords another example of a generalised type, in this case
    probably a fern, combining features which are now distributed
    among the Marattiaceae, Osmundaceae and Cyatheaceae.</p>

  <p>In addition to genera founded on true synangia or groups
    of free or partially united sporangia, the literature of Palaeozoic
    ferns contains several generic names applied to sporangia which
    occur singly on Sphenopteroid or Pecopteroid pinnules. The
    following may serve as examples; but it should be stated that
    these will probably be transferred eventually to the Pteridosperms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
    It is, however, immaterial whether they are dealt
    with here or in the chapter devoted to the seed-bearing “ferns.”</p>

  <p>For a fuller synonymy reference should be made to Kidston’s
    account of this species<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>, from which the above list is compiled.
    The large fronds of this species are tri- or quadripinnate. The
    pinnules vary much in shape and size and in degree of lobing,
    according to their position on the frond (<a href="#fig293">fig. 293</a>). The primary
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>pinnae are subtended by two Aphlebiae (<a href="#fig293">fig. 293</a>, A) appressed
    to the rachis, like the delicate leaves of the recent fern <i>Teratophyllum
    aculeatum</i> (see <a href="#Page_301">page 301</a>). The sporangia (0·5–0·65)
    are oval and exannulate and are attached parallel to the lateral
    veins; they may occupy the whole of the space between the
    midrib and the edge of the pinnules. This species occurs in the
    Upper, Middle, and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain, reaching
    its maximum in the Upper Coal-Measures. The aphlebiae
    undoubtedly served to protect the young fronds, as shown by a
    specimen figured by Kidston (<a href="#fig293">fig. 293</a>, B); they may also have
    served other purposes, as suggested by the above comparison
    with <i>Teratophyllum</i>, in the mature frond. Lindley and Hutton
    regarded the aphlebiae as leaves of a fern climbing up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
    rachis; which they named <i>Schizopteris adnascens</i>, a confusion
    similar to that already mentioned in the description of <i>Hemitelia
    capensis</i> (see p. 304).</p>

  <p>This name was proposed by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> for Upper Carboniferous
    fertile pinnae of the Sphenopteroid type, bearing ovoid sporangia
    either singly or in marginal groups of 2 to 5 at the ends of the
    veins. The appearance of the apical cells occasionally suggests
    the presence of a rudimentary annulus. Kidston has recorded
    this type of fructification in Britain<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>. Stur describes fertile

  <p>This genus was founded by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> for fertile pinnae of a
    very delicate fern, <i>Zeilleria delicatula</i> (Sternb.) characterised
    by filiform ultimate segments bearing an indusium-like body,
    spherical when immature and splitting at maturity into four
    small valves. Kidston, in his earlier paper, compared the
    species with recent Hymenophyllaceae. In the same genus he
    includes <i>Z. avoldensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> (Stur) assigned by Stur to <i>Calymmatotheca</i>,
    a genus described by some authors as characterised by groups of
    radially elongated sporangia at the tips of the pinnules; these
    supposed sporangia are now known to be the valves of an
    indusium-like organ or cupule, as Stur asserted. There can be
    little doubt that the fertile fronds placed in <i>Calymmatotheca</i>
    and in <i>Zeilleria</i> were borne by Pteridosperms.</p>

  <h5 id="Urnatopteris"><i>Urnatopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>The Upper Carboniferous fronds of a delicate Sphenopteris
    habit, to which this name was assigned by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>, were
    described by him as <i>Eusphenopteris tenella</i> (Brongn.)<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> and
    compared with Hymenophyllaceae; subsequently Kidston expressed
    the opinion that <i>Urnatopteris</i> may be a Marattiaceous
    fern, as Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> believed; he has since suggested that
    the sporangia are the microsporangia of a Pteridosperm<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>. The
    sterile and fertile pinnae differ in the absence of a lamina in
    the latter. The sporangia (or microsporangia) are characterised
    by a poricidal dehiscence.</p>

  <p>The records from strata higher in the geological series than
    the Permian, disregarding many of doubtful value, afford ample
    testimony to the existence of Marattiaceae in Upper Triassic
    and Rhaetic floras.</p>

  <h5 id="Marattiopsis"><i>Marattiopsis.</i></h5>

  <p>The generic name <i>Danaeopsis</i> was applied by Heer<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> to an
    Upper Triassic fern, previously described by Presl as <i>Taeniopteris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
    marantacea</i>. A splendid specimen from the Keuper
    of Stuttgart is figured in Schimper’s Atlas<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> showing the
    pinnate habit of the frond and the broadly linear segments,
    25 cm. × 3·5 cm., bearing rows of contiguous sporangia. The
    large pinnules have a strong midrib giving off curved and
    forked lateral veins. Presl’s species may most appropriately be
    included in the genus <i>Marattiopsis</i>. A specimen of <i>M. marantacea</i>
    described by Leuthardt<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> as <i>Danaeopsis marantacea</i> from
    the Upper Trias of Basel shows a peculiarity in the venation;
    the lateral veins often fork near their origin, as noticed by
    other authors, but each vein forks a second time near the edge
    of the lamina and the two arms converge, forming a series of
    intramarginal loops (<a href="#fig265">fig. 265</a>, B).</p>

  <h6><i>Marattiopsis Muensteri</i> (Goepp.). <a href="#fig245">Fig. 245</a>, D, E.</h6>

  <p>This widely spread Rhaetic plant affords the best example
    of a post-Permian species which may be accepted as an authentic
    record of fossil Marattiaceae. Various generic names have been
    used for this species; Goeppert originally described the plant
    as <i>Taeniopteris Muensteri</i><a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>; Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> proposed the name
    <i>Marattiopsis</i>, and Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> substituted <i>Angiopteris</i> on the
    ground that the fertile pinnules resemble that genus rather
    than <i>Marattia</i>. <i>Marattiopsis</i>, if interpreted as indicating a
    <i>family</i> resemblance rather than special affinity to the genus
    <i>Marattia</i>, would seem to be the more appropriate designation.</p>

  <p>This species has been figured by several authors and in
    many instances with fertile pinnules; the best illustrations
    are those published by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> in his monograph of Tonkin
    plants.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The pinnate fronds are characterised by a broad rachis bearing sessile
      broadly linear pinnules rounded at the base, obtusely pointed at the apex,
      reaching a length of 15–20 cm. and a breadth of 12–35 mm. From a
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>well-marked midrib are given off secondary veins dichotomously branched
      close to their origin. The linear synangia near the ends of the veins
      contain two rows of sporangial compartments and open as two valves as
      in <i>Marattia</i>. (Cf. <a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, A, p. 320.)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This species occurs in the Rhaetic beds of Scania, Franconia,
    and Tonkin. A similar type is figured by Fontaine from
    Jurassic beds in California as <i>Angiopteridium californicum</i><a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>,
    and Bartholin<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> and Moeller<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> record <i>M. Muensteri</i> from the Lias of
    Bornholm. Schenk’s species from China<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>, <i>Angiopteris Richthofeni</i>,
    is a closely allied species, and a similar form is recorded
    from Jurassic and Caucasian strata<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>. The microscopical examination
    by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> of a group of spores from a synangium
    of <i>M. Muensteri</i> shows that they resemble those of recent
    Marattiaceae.</p>

  <p>From the Upper Triassic plant beds of Lunz, Stur has
    included several species of ferns in the Marattiaceae, and of
    these Krasser<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> has recently published full diagnoses but unfortunately
    without illustrations. In addition to <i>Marattiopsis
    marantacea</i> (Presl) the list includes species referred to <i>Coniopteris</i>,
    to <i>Speirocarpus</i>, a genus founded by Stur, to <i>Oligocarpia</i>,
    <i>Asterotheca</i>, and <i>Bernouillia</i> (Heer).</p>

  <p>As already pointed out, some at least of these Austrian ferns
    are more probably Osmundaceous than Marattiaceous.</p>

  <h5 id="Danaeopsis"><i>Danaeopsis</i></h5>

  <h6><i>Danaeopsis Hughesi</i>, Feistmantel.</h6>

  <p>The pinnate fronds described by Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> from the
    Middle Gondwana rocks of India and recorded from Rhaetic
    strata in South Africa<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>, China<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>, and Tonkin<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>, may belong to
    a member of the Marattiaceae, but no fertile specimens have
    been described. The close agreement between the sterile leaves
    from India and South Africa and the fertile fronds of <i>Marattiopsis
    marantacea</i> suggests generic identity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

  <p>The Upper Triassic ferns described by Heer, Krasser<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>, and
    Leuthardt<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> as <i>Bernouillia</i> have been referred to the Marattiaceae,
    but without trustworthy evidence in favour of this affinity.</p>

  <p>The large leaves, 70 cm. long and 7 cm. broad, described by
    Zigno<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> from the Jurassic of Italy as <i>Danaeites Heeri</i>, are
    probably Cycadean. The Polish Jurassic species <i>Danaea microphylla</i><a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>
    is a more satisfactory record.</p>

  <h5 id="Nathorstia"><i>Nathorstia.</i></h5>

  <p>This name was instituted by Heer<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> for pieces of pinnate
    fronds from Lower Cretaceous rocks of Greenland. The resemblance
    of the long pinnules to the fertile segments of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span><i>Laccopteris</i> is so close that generic identity might well be
    assumed, but it has recently been shown by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> that
    the soral characters justify Heer’s use of a distinctive name
    for the Arctic fern. The circular sori arranged in two rows
    (<a href="#fig294">fig. 294</a>, A, B) are superficially identical with those of <i>Laccopteris</i>,
    but consist of concrescent sporangia forming a circular
    synangium (<a href="#fig294">fig. 294</a>, C, D) like those of <i>Kaulfussia</i> and
    <i>Ptychocarpus</i>. The lighter areas in <a href="#fig294">fig. 294</a>, D, represent the
    sporangia: fig. C shows the radial disposition of the numerous
    sporangial compartments round a central receptacle. From a
    stout midrib lateral veins arise at right angles, but their distal
    terminations are not preserved. It is probable, as Nathorst
    suggests, that Bayer’s<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> species <i>Drynaria fascia</i> from the Lower
    Cretaceous rocks of Bohemia should be referred to Heer’s genus.
    In the absence of well-preserved sori it would be exceedingly
    difficult, or even impossible, to distinguish between pinnules of
    <i>Laccopteris</i> and <i>Nathorstia</i>.</p>

  <p>A Tertiary species, <i>Marattia Hookeri</i> (<a href="#fig261">fig. 261</a>, C, p. 350),
    described by Gardner and Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> from the Eocene beds
    of the Isle of Wight is referred by them to the Marattiaceae
    because of a resemblance of the sterile pinnae to those of
    <i>M. Kaulfussii</i>; but this is insufficient evidence of relationship.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">Psaronieae.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">This</span> family name, first suggested by Unger, may be conveniently
    adopted for the numerous species of petrified tree-fern
    stems characteristic of the Lower Permian and Upper
    Carboniferous strata. In his monograph <i>Über die Staarsteine</i>
    published in 1854, Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> referred to the Psaronieae as a
    special subdivision of the Filices most nearly allied to the
    Polypodiaceae. There is now a consensus of opinion in favour
    of including <i>Psaronius</i> in the Marattiales, or at least of regarding
    the genus as more closely allied to the Marattiaceae than to any
    other family. While admitting that the balance of evidence is
    in favour of this view, it is probably wiser to retain the distinctive
    term Psaronieae on the ground that species of <i>Psaronius</i>
    differ in several respects from any recent ferns, and because
    of our comparative ignorance in regard to the nature of the
    fructification.</p>

  <h5><i>Psaronius.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name was proposed by Cotta in his classic
    work <i>Die Dendrolithen</i><a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>. The stems so named, formerly included
    by Sprengel<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> in the genus <i>Endogenites</i>, had long been familiar
    as petrified fossils. Most of the specimens described by the
    earlier writers were obtained from Lower Permian rocks in the
    neighbourhood of Chemnitz, Saxony. The mottled appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
    presented by their polished surfaces is said to have
    given rise to the appellation <i>Staarsteine</i> (starling stones), a
    term expressing a resemblance, more or less remote, to a
    starling’s breast. It has been suggested that this word is a
    corruption of <i>Stern Steine</i> or star stones<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a>, a descriptive term
    suggested by the stellate arrangement of the vascular strands
    in transverse sections of the roots. Parkinson<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>, in his <i>Organic
    Remains of a former World</i>, speaks of these stems as starry
    stones. The history of our knowledge prior to 1854 is summarised
    by Stenzel. At first compared with corals or the
    stems of sea-lilies, <i>Psaronii</i> were recognised by Sprengel, who
    first used a lens in the examination of the fossils, as fern stems
    most nearly allied to those of recent Cyatheaceae. By other
    authors, e.g. Schlotheim and Sternberg, they were referred to
    Palms, and by Brongniart considered to be the lower portions
    of Lycopodiaceous (<i>Lepidodendron</i>) stems. Corda and many
    subsequent authors selected the Marattiaceae as the most
    closely allied family among existing plants.</p>

  <p><i>Psaronius</i> is represented by specimens obtained from the
    Lower Permian of Saxony and Upper Carboniferous rocks in
    Central France, also from Bohemia, Brazil and North America.
    As yet a few fragments only have been found in the English
    Coal-Measures. The genus was recognised by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> who
    described the roots and a small piece of the vascular tissue of a
    stem which he called <i>P. Renaulti</i>, and this type has since been
    more fully described by Scott<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>. The roots of another species
    have been described by Butterworth<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> as <i>P. Cromptonensis</i>.</p>

  <p>It was pointed out in the account of <i>Lepidodendron</i> that
    several generic names have been used for the same type of
    stem in different states of preservation; in <i>Psaronius</i> accidents
    of fossilisation have been responsible for a similar confusion in
    nomenclature. The name <i>Psaronius</i> is applied to petrified
    specimens which, as a rule, lack external features. Casts or
    impressions of Palaeozoic tree-fern stems provided with leaf-scars
    are described as species of <i>Caulopteris</i>, <i>Megaphyton</i>, and
    less commonly as <i>Ptychopteris</i> (<a href="#fig297">figs. 297–299</a>). The first name
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>is applied to stems exhibiting spirally disposed leaf-scars like
    those of recent tree-ferns; in <i>Megaphyton</i> the scars are distichously
    arranged, in two rows, while <i>Ptychopteris</i> is applied
    to decorticated stems. These terms are used for stems belonging
    to one generic type and possessing the structure of Psaronius
    stems.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 295.
      <i>Psaronius</i> stem with roots. (Much reduced. After Grand’Eury.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The researches of Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> led to the discovery that
    certain Psaronius stems bore fronds of the <i>Pecopteris</i> type
    some of which bore sori of the <i>Asterotheca</i> or <i>Scolecopteris</i> type.
    The same author<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> has also contributed many interesting facts,
    obtained by an examination of the relation of Psaronius stems
    to the sediments of French Coal-fields in which they occur,
    in regard to habitat and manner of growth. The specimen
    represented in <a href="#fig295">fig. 295</a> shows a portion of a Psaronius stem, the
    upper part of which illustrates the Caulopteris state of preservation,
    while the lower part is covered by a mass of roots. It
    is probable, as Rudolph<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> suggests, that this rich development of
    roots, which gives to an old Psaronius stem the appearance of an
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>elongated cone, may have served an important mechanical
    purpose analogous to the secondary thickening in a Dicotyledon
    or a Conifer. A specimen of <i>Psaronius Cottai</i> in the
    Hofmuseum, Vienna, is cited in illustration of the enormous breadth
    of the root-system: the radii of the stem proper and of the
    encasing cylinder of roots bear the ratio 17 to 165. The
    comparatively frequent occurrence of a lacunar cortex in the
    roots points to the growth of the stems in swampy ground, a
    conclusion in harmony with the evidence afforded by the anatomical
    features of many other Palaeozoic genera.</p>

    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p><i>Psaronius</i> may be briefly defined as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Tree-fern stems, occasionally reaching a height of 50 feet or more,
      closely resembling in habit recent tree ferns, but exhibiting in the structure
      and arrangement of the vascular system a close agreement with recent
      Marattiaceae. Leaves, in such cases where a connexion between fronds and
      stems is known, large and highly compound and of the <i>Pecopteris</i> type,
      borne in more or less crowded spirals (<i>Psaronius polystichi</i>), in four rows
      (<i>P. tetrastichi</i>), or in two opposite rows (<i>P. distichi</i>). Leaves deciduous,
      leaving a clearly defined oval scar containing the impression of the leaf-trace
      in the form of an open <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>, or a closed oval with a small inverted
      <span class="sans"><b>V</b></span>-shaped band a short distance below the upper end of the long axis of
      the oval (figs. <a href="#fig297">297</a>, <a href="#fig298">298</a>); in <i>Megaphyton</i> the alternate scars of the two
      opposite series are larger and characterised by a different form of meristele.
      The surface of the cortex below the leaf-scars occasionally shows
      impressions of pits similar to the lenticel-like organs on recent Tree-fern
      stems. The central region of the stem is occupied by a complex system of
      concentrically disposed steles (dictyosteles), which in transverse section
      present the appearance of flat or curved bands varying in extent and in
      degree of curvature. The vascular bands consist of xylem surrounded by
      a narrow zone of phloem; the xylem is composed either exclusively of
      tracheae or of tracheae and parenchyma; the protoxylem in the one
      instance in which it has been clearly recognised is endarch<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>. The steles
      are embedded in parenchymatous tissue and in some species are associated
      with mechanical tissue (e.g. <i>P. infarctus</i>, <a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, A, B). The central or
      vascular region of the stem may be surrounded externally by a cylinder of
      mechanical tissue interrupted by outgoing leaf-traces and adventitious
      roots. The leaf-traces arise as single bundles from an internal stelar
      band and pursue an obliquely radial course towards the outside, eventually
      anastomosing with peripheral cauline steles, which in some species
      form with the leaf-traces the outermost zone of the vascular region.
      The leaf-traces have the form of loops which pass into the petioles as
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span><span class="sans"><b>V</b></span>-shaped meristeles or closed oval cylinders. As a leaf-trace passes out
      compensating strands occupy the foliar gap.</p>

    <p>The vascular region is surrounded by a parenchymatous cortex, which
      in younger plants, or in the apical region of an older plant, forms the
      surface of the stem to which the leaf-stalks are attached. From the
      peripheral steles, or from the more external bands of the vascular network,
      roots are given off which pass in a sinuous vertical course through the
      cortex, appearing on the surface between the leaf-bases. In older stems,
      after leaf-fall, the tissue immediately external to the vascular region
      produces secondary parenchyma with which the roots become intimately
      associated by their outermost cells. As a result of the secondary cortical
      development and the gradual increase in the number of roots invading
      the cortical tissue from above, the stem is enclosed by a cylinder of roots
      and associated parenchymatous tissue of secondary origin. In still older
      portions of a stem the more external roots are free from the stem-cortex
      and form a thick felted mantle, which increases in thickness towards
      the base of the tree.</p>

    <p>The roots (<a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, E) are polyarch, 5–10 groups of xylem alternating
      with strands of phloem, and similar in structure to those of recent species
      of <i>Marattia</i> and <i>Angiopteris</i>; the stele is enclosed by an inner cortex of
      compact or lacunar tissue containing secretory sacs, and this is surrounded
      by a cylinder of mechanical tissue. In one or two instances secondary
      xylem has been observed wholly or partially enclosing the root-stele<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>.</p>

    work of Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> and that of Rudolph. A striking fact, which
    has led to various suggestions, is that in a transverse section of
    a <i>Psaronius</i> stem with its encasing cylinder of roots no signs of
    leaf-traces are met with in the root-region. If the roots simply
    penetrated the cortex, as in some recent species of <i>Lycopodium</i>
    (<a href="#fig125">fig. 125</a>, A) or as in <i>Angiopteris</i>, we should expect to find
    leaf-traces in the outer region (root-cylinder) of Psaronius
    stems. An explanation of the absence of leaf-traces which was
    suggested by Stenzel, is that the cortical zone formed a
    comparatively narrow band in the young leaf-covered stem;
    after leaf-fall it became the seat of active growth in its inner
    layers and so produced a constantly widening zone of secondary
    parenchyma, which pushed the superficial cortical tissue with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>the leaf-bases or leaf-scars farther out until it was exfoliated.
    Farmer and Hill<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> find it difficult to accept this explanation; but,
    as Rudolph shows, the radial arrangement of the cortical cells
    between the adventitious roots and their elongation in a radial
    direction are arguments in support of the secondary nature of
    the cortical zone.</p>

  <p>In sections of the adventitious roots of <i>Psaronius Renaulti</i>
    figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>, the spaces between the cylindrical roots
    are partially occupied by cell-filaments which, at first sight,
    suggest root-hairs; it may well be, as Rudolph suggests, that
    these felted hairs represent the outermost and looser part of
    the growing secondary cortex which gradually passes into the
    covering mass of free extra-cortical roots.</p>

  <p>As Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> has shown, slender stems of <i>Zygopteris</i> (= <i>Ankyropteris</i>)
    are occasionally met with growing through the web
    of Psaronius roots.</p>

  <h6><i>Psaronius infarctus</i> Unger. Fig. 296, A, B.</h6>

  <p>This species, which Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> has investigated from sections of
    Unger’s material, illustrates a type in which the vascular tissue
    is very richly developed and forms crowded concentric series of
    curved plates associated, in the more peripheral series, with
    bands of mechanical tissue. The outermost part of the vascular
    region consists of (i) a series of loops or variously curved bands
    of conducting tissue representing leaf-traces at different stages
    in their outward course, (ii) a series of similar vascular strands
    (peripheral steles of Zeiller) confined to the stem (cauline) and
    from which roots are given off, and (iii) bands of mechanical
    tissue associated with the leaf-traces and peripheral steles.
    The peripheral steles (<a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, A, B, p) form anastomoses with
    the leaf-traces and contribute to their formation.</p>

  <p>The form of some of the vascular bands in the section
    of <i>Psaronius infarctus</i> shown in <a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, A, illustrates the
    occasional anastomosing of one dictyostele with another: the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>different degrees of looping of other bands represent stages
    in the giving off of leaf-traces which eventually pass out
    as <span class="sans"><b>V</b></span>-shaped meristeles. Beyond the leaf-traces and sclerenchymatous
    bands the section consists of transverse sections of
    adventitious roots.</p>

  <p>The surface-features of <i>Psaronius infarctus</i> are probably
    represented, as Zeiller points out, by the cast described by
    Lesquereux as <i>Caulopteris peltigera</i> (<a href="#fig298">fig. 298</a>, A).</p>

  <p>The Psaronius shown in <a href="#fig297">fig. 297</a> is one of the few examples
    illustrating the connexion between fronds and stem. The leaf
    (<i>Pecopteris Sterzeli</i> Zeill. and Ren.<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> is quadripinnate and is
    described as reaching a length of at least 3 metres; the
    ultimate segments are entire or lobed. The stem is characterised
    by elliptical scars, 6–8 cm. x 3·5–4 cm., with leaf-traces
    like those in <i>Caulopteris peltigera</i>. The fronds of
    <i>Pecopteris Pluckeneti</i>, a Pteridosperm, bear a very close
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>resemblance to those of <i>P. Sterzeli</i>, which are as yet known

  <p><i>Psaronius brasiliensis</i> Unger, a species founded by Unger
    on a piece of silicified stem acquired by Martius in Brazil and
    now in the Rio Museum, is a good example of a tetrastichous
    species. Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> has recently told the history of this
    type, which is represented by sections, cut from the Rio stem,
    in several European collections. A well-preserved section in
    the British Museum is figured by Arber<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> in his catalogue
    of the Glossopteris flora and by other authors. Scott gives
    a concise description of the species in his <i>Studies in Fossil
    Botany</i><a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>. The roots of <i>P. brasiliensis</i> are stated by Pelourde<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>
    to have a lacunar cortex.</p>

  <h6><i>Psaronius musaeformis</i> Corda<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>. Fig. 296, D.</h6>

  <p>This species from the Lower Permian of Chemnitz and the
    Coal-Measures of Bohemia affords an example of the distichous
    type in which the leaves are borne in two rows. The vascular
    bands, as seen in a section of the dictyosteles, occur in regular
    parallel series. The stelar region is separated from the cylinder
    of encasing roots by a sclerenchymatous sheath, broken at
    intervals where roots pass out from the vascular region.</p>

  <p><i>Psaronius coalescens</i><a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> (<a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, C) illustrates a somewhat
    different arrangement of vascular tissue which approaches more
    closely to the polycyclic structure characteristic of such recent
    ferns as <i>Matonia</i> and <i>Saccoloma</i>. A still closer resemblance to
    the solenostelic type is seen in <i>Psaronius Renaulti</i> from the
    Lower Coal-Measures of England which Scott<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> describes as
    characterised by a single annular stele, interrupted only by
    the exit of leaf-traces. As he points out, it is noteworthy that
    this species is distinguished by the simplest form of stele met
    with in the genus; it is the oldest species and may be regarded
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>as the most primitive representative of the genus <i>Psaronius</i> so
    far discovered.</p>

  <h5>i. <i>Caulopteris</i>.</h5>

  <p>This generic name was instituted by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
    for tree-fern stems from the English Coal-Measures showing
    circular or oval scars arranged quincuncially. The vascular tissue
    of the petiole is represented by a <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>-shaped impression on the
    scar, the ends of the <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span> being incurved, or by a closed oval ring
    with a wide-open and inverted <span class="sans"><b>V</b></span> near its upper end. The
    surface between the leaf-scars bears the impression of adventitious
    roots. <i>Caulopteris</i> is represented, in the Upper Coal-Measures
    of England, by <i>C. anglica</i><a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> Kidst. The species
    <i>C. peltigera</i> (<a href="#fig298">fig. 298</a>, A), originally described by Brongniart as
    <i>Sigillaria</i>, illustrates the closed form of leaf-trace and, as Zeiller
    suggests, it is the cast of a <i>Psaronius</i> stem which possessed
    a vascular system on the same plan as that of <i>P. infarctus</i>.
    <i>C. Saportae</i><a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> illustrates the open
    <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>-shaped type of petiole stele.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

  <p><i>Caulopteris peltigera</i> has scars measuring 6–9 by 4–6 cm.;
    it occurs in the Commentry Coal-field of France in association
    with the fronds known as <i>Pecopteris cyathea</i>, a species
    which Kidston regards as identical with <i>P. arborescens</i><a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>.</p>

  <h5>ii. <i>Megaphyton</i>.</h5>

  <p>The first use of this name was by Artis<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>, who gave it to a long
    flattened cast, <i>Megaphyton frondosum</i>, found in Carboniferous
    strata in Yorkshire, characterised by two vertical rows of large
    scars and by impressions of sinuous roots. Kidston records the
    genus from the Middle and Upper Coal-Measures of Britain.
    A good example of this type of cast is afforded by <i>M. McLayi</i>
    Lesq.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> from the Coal-Measures of North America, which has
    been recognised in European Carboniferous rocks. The leaf-scars
    are rounded or oval, broader than high; the vascular
    impression has the form of a closed ring (5–8 × 3–6 cm.),
    more or less circular and with a tendency to a rectangular
    outline, characterised by a deep inverted <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>-shaped sinus in the
    middle of the lower surface and by a <span class="sans"><b>W</b></span>-shaped impression
    of an internal strand (<a href="#fig298">fig. 298</a>, B)<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>.</p>

  <h5>iii. <i>Ptychopteris</i>.</h5>

  <p>This generic name, instituted by Corda<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>, is applied to
    decorticated stems of <i>Psaronius</i>, the surface of which is that
    of the vascular region on which the form of the leaf-scars is
    more or less clearly defined. The scar-areas are limited by an
    impression of the sclerenchymatous sheath enclosing the leaf-meristele,
    and internal to this is the impression of the leaf-trace.
    In some specimens a layer of coaly material which represents
    the carbonised cortex and adventitious roots covers the <i>Ptychopteris</i>
    cast. The <i>Ptychopteris</i> cast represented in <a href="#fig299">fig. 299</a>
    shows the decorticated surface of part of a long stem on which
    the leaf-scars are arranged as in <i>Megaphyton</i>. An example of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span><i>Ptychopteris</i> is figured by Fontaine and White<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> from Virginia as

  <h5><i>Position of</i> Psaronius.</h5>

  <p>A comparison of <i>Psaronius</i> with the Marattiaceae and other
    recent ferns leads to the conclusion that, on the whole, the
    evidence is in favour of the view usually held, namely that
    this genus is more closely related to the Marattiaceae than to
    any other recent ferns. It is, however, important not to overlook
    the differences between <i>Psaronius</i> and recent genera of
    Marattiaceae, or the resemblances between the extinct genus
    and the Cyatheaceae. In habit <i>Psaronius</i> agrees closely with
    recent tree-ferns; in the vascular system and in the sequence
    of events connected with the production of leaf-traces, there are
    striking resemblances between <i>Psaronius</i> and the Cyatheaceous
    fern <i>Saccoloma adiantoides</i> (= <i>Dicksonia Plumieri</i> Hook.) as
    described by Mettenius<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>. The piece of stem of <i>Dicksonia
    antarctica</i> represented in <a href="#fig300">fig. 300</a> exhibits a fairly close agreement
    with species of <i>Psaronius</i>, e.g. <i>P. infarctus</i> (<a href="#fig296">fig. 296</a>, A, B).
    Moreover, the peripheral steles, which Zeiller has shown are
    confined to the stem and play an important part in the production
    of the roots and in the anastomoses with leaf-traces,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>are not represented in any Marattiaceous fern; on the other
    hand, they are comparable with the accessory strands met with
    in stems of recent Cyatheaceous tree-ferns<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> (cf. <a href="#fig240">fig. 240</a>). The
    complex system of concentric dictyosteles is a feature more closely
    matched in <i>Angiopteris</i> (Marattiaceae) than in any Cyatheaceous
    genus, the chief difference being in the more band-like
    form of the steles in <i>Psaronius</i>, though in a stem of <i>Angiopteris</i>
    figured by Mettenius we see a close approach to the extinct
    type. The position of the protoxylem has unfortunately not
    been clearly defined in <i>Psaronius</i> stems, but in <i>P. Renaulti</i> it
    is stated by Scott<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> to be endarch, a position which some of the
    protoxylem strands occupy in <i>Angiopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>. The occurrence of
    large sieve-tubes described by Scott in <i>P. Renaultii</i> is another
    feature shared by recent Marattiaceae. In many of the continental
    species of <i>Psaronius</i> the phloem has not been preserved,
    and our knowledge of this tissue is comparatively meagre. In
    the Marattiaceae the roots arise mainly from the inner portions
    of the stele, while in <i>Psaronius</i> they are usually formed from
    the external vascular bands. The formation of secondary cortical
    tissue is a peculiarity of <i>Psaronius</i>; on the other hand, if
    Butterworth<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> is correct in referring to that genus the roots
    with secondary xylem, which he describes as <i>P. Cromptonensis</i>,
    a comparison may be made with the occurrence of secondary
    tracheae in the stem steles of <i>Angiopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>.</p>

  <p>The absence of mechanical tissue in the stem of <i>Angiopteris</i>
    is in contrast with its occurrence in the fossil stems and in
    recent tree-ferns; but this is a character of secondary importance
    and one which can be readily explained by the difference
    in habit between <i>Angiopteris</i> and <i>Psaronius</i>.</p>

  <p>The roots of <i>Psaronius</i>, more especially as regards the stelar
    structure, are in close agreement with those of Marattiaceae.</p>

  <p>The reference to Marattiaceae of the great majority of fertile
    fern-like fronds from Permian and Carboniferous rocks constituted
    a strong <i>a priori</i> argument in favour of including
    <i>Psaronius</i> stems in the same family, especially when it was
    known that leaves with Marattiaceous synangia were borne by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>species of this genus. It is, however, well to remember the
    change in our views as to the dominance of Marattiaceae in
    Palaeozoic floras consequent on the discovery of the Pteridosperms.
    The association of fronds bearing <i>Asterotheca</i> and
    <i>Scolecopteris</i> types of fructification with <i>Psaronius</i> stems recorded
    by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> is a point in favour of the Marattiaceous affinity
    of this extinct genus, but it is not impossible that <i>Psaronius</i>
    stems bore fronds which produced Pteridosperm organs of reproduction.
    In this connexion the specimen represented in
    <a href="#fig297">fig. 297</a> is of interest, as the fronds (<i>Pecopteris Sterzeli</i>) borne
    on the <i>Psaronius</i> stems are hardly distinguishable from the
    seed-bearing leaves known as <i>Pecopteris Pluckeneti</i>.</p>

  <p>The position of <i>Psaronius</i> may be best expressed by assigning
    it to a separate family, the Psaronieae, as advocated by Stenzel,
    and by regarding it as one of the many instances of a generalised
    type which in the sum of its characters approaches most nearly
    to the Marattiaceae.</p>

    history or phylogeny of the group. In the generalised class of

      <i>Rhacopteris</i> sp., Ballycastle, Ireland. From a specimen in the Manchester Museum. [M.S.]</div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Rhacopteris</i> (<a href="#fig301">fig. 301</a>), characteristic of the Culm
    flora, has been compared with <i>Botrychium</i>, but on grounds which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
    are wholly inadequate. The species <i>R. paniculifera</i> Stur<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> is
    characterised by a stout rachis bearing two rows of laterally
    attached rhomboidal or subtriangular segments with a more or
    less deeply lobed margin and spreading veins. The rachis
    branches distally into two arms, and these are again symmetrically
    subdivided into fertile axes bearing clusters of small
    spherical bodies 1 mm. broad, which Stur speaks of as exannulate
    sporangia similar to those of <i>Botrychium</i>. He includes
    the species in the Ophioglossaceae. As Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> pertinently
    remarks, <i>Rhacopteris</i> differs essentially in habit from any recent
    member of this family. <i>Rhacopteris</i> also includes species characterised
    by leaflets deeply dissected into linear segments; an
    example of this form is represented by <i>Rhacopteris flabellata</i>
    (Tate) recorded by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> from rocks of Calciferous Sandstone
    age in Flintshire.</p>

  <p>The specimen described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> from the Carboniferous
    rocks of Autun as <i>Ophioglossites antiqua</i> is equally unconvincing:
    it consists of a carbonised fragment, 7 cm. × 1·5 cm., regarded as
    part of a fertile lamina characterised by a vertical series of
    transversely elongated slits, 7 mm. wide, some of which, on
    slight magnification, are seen to contain a mass of small orange-yellow
    granulations. The slits are compared with the surface-openings
    of the sunken sporangia of <i>Ophioglossum</i>, and the
    yellow bodies are identified as spores. The material is too
    imperfect to justify the use of the name <i>Ophioglossites</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Noeggerathia.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus of uncertain position may be briefly described
    here, though it has little claim to recognition as a representative
    of the <i>Ophioglossales</i>. It is characteristic of Lower
    Carboniferous rocks and is compared by Stur<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> with recent
    Ophioglossaceae. <i>Noeggerathia foliosa</i> Sternb. (<a href="#fig302">fig. 302</a>) may
    be cited as a typical example of the genus. It consists of an
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>axis bearing ovate leaves with numerous spreading veins. The
    upper part of the axis forms a spike composed of fertile leaves
    in the form of transversely oval bracts 2 cm. broad with a serrate
    edge bearing on the upper face several sporangia (3 × 4 mm.) in
    some of which spores have been seen (<a href="#fig302">fig. 302</a>, B, C). In
    another form described by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> the bracts bear a greater
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>number of sporangia characterised by the presence of an arillus-like
    basal ring.</p>

  <p>Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>, who first described fertile specimens of <i>Noeggerathia</i>,
    placed the genus in the Gymnosperms, and O. Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>
    was in favour of this view. C. Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>, who described
    the small bodies in the sporangia, suggested comparison with
    Schizaeaceae, and Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> discussed various possibilities, asking
    but not answering the question, are the so-called sporangia
    rightly so named or are they fruits? Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> places the
    genus in the Cycadofilices. An important feature is the
    occurrence of the sporangia on the upper face of the bracts
    as in Lycopodiales and <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, but in other respects
    <i>Noeggerathia</i> bears no resemblance to these two groups. Sterile
    examples of the genus are similar in habit to <i>Rhacopteris</i>, but
    in the latter genus the leaves or leaflets are laterally attached
    and not obliquely inserted. Further, we may assume that in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span><i>Rhacopteris</i> the segments are leaflets of a compound leaf,
    whereas in <i>Noeggerathia</i> they are probably single leaves. We
    must leave the position of this Lower Carboniferous genus
    undecided, merely expressing the opinion that it is perhaps
    more nearly allied to the Cycads than to any other group.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The plant figured by Lindley and Hutton from the English
    Coal-Measures as <i>Noeggerathia flabellata</i>, which some authors
    quote as a species of <i>Noeggerathia</i>, is generally recognised as
    a <i>Psygmophyllum</i> and placed with some hesitation in the
    Ginkgoales.</p>

  <h5><i>Chiropteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus was founded by Kurr on a leaf characterised
    by anastomosing venation from Keuper beds near Stuttgart.
    A resemblance in form and venation to the leaves of
    recent species of <i>Ophioglossum</i> led authors to suggest the
    inclusion of Kurr’s specimen in the Ophioglossaceae. We
    have, however, no justification for considering <i>Chiropteris</i> as a
    member of this family; it may be a fern, and that is all that
    can be said. The leaf represented in <a href="#fig303">fig. 303</a> is the type-specimen
    of a South African Rhaetic species <i>Chiropteris
    Zeilleri</i><a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>. The genus is recorded also from Rhaetic rocks in
    Queensland.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

  <p>Newberry<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> describes some leaves from the Lower Cretaceous
    of Montana as species of <i>Chiropteris</i>: one of his types,
    <i>C. spatulata</i>, is almost certainly a <i>Sagenopteris</i>, similar to
    <i>S. Phillipsi</i> (figs. <a href="#fig327">327</a>, <a href="#fig328">328</a>) or <i>S. Mantelli</i>. A second species,
    <i>C. Williamsii</i>, is probably not generically identical with the
    specimen represented in <a href="#fig303">fig. 303</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> term Botryopterideae, first used by Renault, has been
    applied to a group of Palaeozoic ferns ranging from the Lower
    Carboniferous to the Permian and containing several genera,
    the distinguishing features of which are supplied by the
    anatomical structure of the stems or, in many cases, by that
    of the petiolar vascular strand. Scott<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> subdivides the Botryopterideae
    into the Botryopteris and the Zygopteris sections. In
    an admirable monograph recently published by Paul Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
    considerable changes are proposed in current nomenclature; he
    substitutes the name Inversicatenales for Botryopterideae, a
    designation, which as Scott remarks, is “probably too technical
    to command general acceptance.” A more serious criticism is
    that the name Inversicatenales has reference to a character
    (the inverse curvature of the leaf-trace in relation to the axis
    of the stem) which is by no means universal in the group<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>.</p>

  <p>In the following account, necessarily incomplete, the generic
    terminology of Bertrand is adopted, but this decision does not
    carry with it any obligation to accept the name Inversicatenales.
    We may speak of the types of Palaeozoic ferns dealt with in
    the following pages as members of a group differing in many
    respects from any existing genera of the Filicales, and exhibiting
    the characteristics associated with generalised plants.
    Williamson, as early as 1883, spoke of Renault’s Botryopterideae<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
    as comprising “altogether extinct and generalised”
    types<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>. For these generalised Palaeozoic ferns I propose to use
    the name Coenopterideae<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>. This term may be adopted in a
    wider sense than Renault’s name Botryopterideae. The name
    Primofilices proposed by Arber<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> might be employed, but the
    implication which it carries is an argument against its
    adoption. We have not yet reached a stage in the investigation
    of extinct types at which we are able to recognise
    what are actually primary or primitive ferns. The search for
    origins will continue; as new discoveries are made our point
    of view shifts and the primitive type of to-day may to-morrow
    have to take a higher place. The epithet primitive or primary
    is in reality provisional: to adopt such a name as Primofilices
    suggests a finality which has not been, or is likely to
    be, achieved. The true ancestral type—the <i>Urform</i>—which
    we strive to discover eludes the pursuer like a will-o’-the-wisp.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the number of true ferns of Palaeozoic age has
    been recently considerably reduced and is likely to suffer further
    reduction, the consideration of such undoubted Carboniferous
    and Permian examples of the Filicales as are left acquires a
    special importance. In the first place it is natural to ask
    whether the Palaeozoic ferns include any types which, if not
    themselves ancestral forms, may serve to indicate the probable
    lines of evolution of existing families. It is probable that in
    the near future our knowledge of the Coenopterideae will be
    considerably extended; as yet we possess meagre information
    in regard to those characters on which most stress has generally
    been laid in the classification of recent ferns, namely the
    structure of the spore-bearing organs. The sporangia of
    <i>Diplolabis</i> and <i>Stauropteris</i> (figs. <a href="#fig309">309</a>, A; <a href="#fig322">322</a>) are exannulate;
    in the former genus they occur in sori or synangia consisting
    of a small number of sporangia, while in the latter they are
    borne singly at the tips of ultimate ramifications of a highly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>compound leaf. The resemblance of the synangium of <i>Diplolabis</i>
    to that of <i>Kaulfussia</i> (<a href="#fig245">fig. 245</a>, C) is not shared in an
    equal degree by the sporangia of <i>Stauropteris</i>, which are in
    some respects comparable with those of the Ophioglossaceae.
    In the Zygoptereae, or at least in the case of such fertile fronds
    as are known, and in <i>Botryopteris</i> (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>), the sporangia occur
    in groups, and the pedicel of each sporangium is supplied with
    vascular tissue as in <i>Helminthostachys</i>. Another characteristic
    of the sporangia of the extinct types is the possession of an
    annulus several cells in breadth, a peculiarity which supplies a
    point of contact with the Osmundaceae. In the sporangia of
    <i>Kidstonia</i> we have a similar though not an identical type (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>,
    E, p. 340). So far, then, as the evidence afforded by sporangial
    characters is concerned, it points to comparison with the
    Ophioglossaceae, the Osmundaceae, and the Marattiaceae.
    When we compare the steles of the stems we find a wide
    range of structure. All the genera agree in being monostelic;
    in <i>Tubicaulis</i> and <i>Grammatopteris</i> the protoxylem is exarch,
    in <i>Botryopteris</i> it is internal, while the foliar strand of
    <i>Stauropteris</i> and the stele of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> are
    mesarch. The axillary branching of species of <i>Ankyropteris</i>
    suggests comparison with the Hymenophyllaceae.</p>

  <p>The investigation of the vascular system of the petioles has
    afforded results which in the hands of P. Bertrand have led to
    conclusions in regard to inter-relationships. We must, however,
    not overlook the danger of attributing can excessive importance
    to this single criterion and of neglecting the facts of stem
    anatomy.</p>

  <h3 id="Botryoptereae">I. Botryoptereae.</h3>

  <h5><i>Grammatopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>Renault instituted this genus for petrified stems from the
    Permo-Carboniferous beds of Autun. <i>Grammatopteris Rigolloti</i><a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>,
    the type-species, is represented by a fragment, 12–15 mm. in
    diameter, surrounded by crowded petioles characterised by a
    vascular strand in the form of a short and comparatively broad
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>plate with the smallest tracheae at each end. The solid xylem
    of the stem stele (protostele) has peripheral groups of protoxylem.
    Nothing is known as to the form of the leaves, but
    sporangia similar to those of <i>Etapteris</i> (<i>Zygopteris</i>) were found
    in association with the stem. It is possible, as P. Bertrand
    suggests, that Renault’s species may be the stem of a
    <i>Tubicaulis</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Tubicaulis.</i></h5>

  <h6><i>Tubicaulis solenites</i> (Sprengel)<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a>. Fig. 304.</h6>

  <p>This species from the Lower Permian of Saxony has been fully
    described by Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>. It is characterised by a very slender
    erect stem bearing numerous spirally disposed leaves associated
    with adventitious roots; the single stele (protostele) consists
    exclusively of tracheae, described as intermediate between the
    scalariform and reticulate type, surrounded by phloem. Leaf-traces
    are given off from the periphery of the stele where groups
    of smaller elements occur; these have the form of a wide-open
    <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span>-shaped strand with the base of the <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span> facing the axis of the
    stem. As the trace passes out towards the leaves, the ends of
    the <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span> become more or less incurved. The stem is said to reach
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>a metre in length and to bear compound fronds a metre long.
    The orientation of the leaf-trace with its concavity turned
    outwards is in striking contrast to the relation between leaf-trace
    and stem in recent ferns.</p>

  </div>

  <h6><i>Tubicaulis Sutcliffii</i>, Stopes<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>.</h6>

  <p>In this species the vascular axis, 2 mm. in diameter, is
    almost cylindrical and of the protostelic type with the protoxylem
    “near to or at the edge”: the tracheae are scalariform
    or reticulate. The leaf-traces, when first separated from the
    edge of the stele, are oval and gradually assume the curved
    form seen in <i>T. solenites</i> (<a href="#fig304">fig. 304</a>) with the convex side towards
    the axis of the stem. The transition from the scalariform to
    the reticulate type of pitting on the tracheal walls referred to
    by Miss Stopes has also been noticed in some recent ferns
    (e.g. <i>Helminthostachys</i>) and in <i>Sigillaria</i> (<a href="#fig200">fig. 200</a>, C, p. 212).
    The fact that the scalariform type of pitting is practically
    universal in the xylem of recent ferns, would seem to show
    that this character has been acquired in the course of evolution
    and retained in preference to the reticulate form characteristic
    of several Palaeozoic species. The distinction between the two
    methods of pitting is one of little phylogenetic importance.</p>

  <h5><i>Botryopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus, founded by Renault on a specimen from Autun,
    is represented in the Lower Coal-Measures of England by
    <i>Botryopteris hirsuta</i> (= <i>Rachiopteris hirsuta</i> Will.), <i>B. ramosa</i>
    (= <i>R. ramosa</i> Will.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>) (<a href="#fig306">fig. 306</a>) and <i>B. cylindrica</i> (<a href="#fig305">fig. 305</a>), also
    by <i>B. antiqua</i> (<a href="#fig307">fig. 307</a>) from the Culm of Pettycur, Scotland.</p>

  <p>An important characteristic of the genus is the solid stele
    of the stem which agrees with that of <i>Tubicaulis</i> and <i>Grammatopteris</i>,
    except in the central or peripheral position of the
    smallest tracheae.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>
  <h6><i>Botryopteris forensis</i> Renault<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>. Figs. <a href="#fig309">309</a>, B; <a href="#fig319">319</a>, D–G.</h6>

  <p>The stem of this species from the Upper Carboniferous of
    St Étienne is 1·7 cm. x 7·5 mm. in diameter. The solid stele
    consists of reticulate tracheae with the smallest elements on
    the outer edge. The comparatively broad cortex of the type-specimen
    is traversed by a leaf-trace in an almost vertical
    course and by vascular strands passing horizontally to roots.
    The petioles are circular in section and their vascular strand
    has the form of an ω in transverse section (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>, G), the
    three projecting arms pointing to the axis of the stem. Both
    stem and leaves bore large multicellular hairs, spoken of by
    Renault as equisetiform because of the finely toothed sheaths
    of which they are composed. The compound fronds had fleshy
    lobed pinnules with dichotomously branched veins (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, B);
    stomata are said to be confined to the upper surface, an
    observation which leads Renault to describe the plant as
    aquatic on evidence which is hardly convincing.</p>

  <p>The pyriform and pedicellate sporangia are borne in groups
    of two to six on the ultimate divisions of the frond; the
    wall is composed of two layers of cells and on one side of the
    sporangium is an annulus several cells in breadth (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>,
    D, F). An interesting type of sporangium described by Oliver<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>
    from Grand’Croix in France may, as he suggests, belong to
    <i>Botryopteris forensis</i>; the differences between Renault’s and
    Oliver’s specimens being the result of the more perfect preservation
    of the tissues in the latter. The sporangium described
    by the English author is circular in section and measures
    0·65 × 0·53 mm.; the wall is in part composed of a single layer
    of cells and in part of two to three layers, a character recalling
    the “annulate” sporangia of <i>Botryopteris</i>. Between the spore-mass
    and the wall is an interrupted ring of short tracheal
    elements similar to the xylem-mantle which occurs at the
    periphery of the nucellus of certain Palaeozoic gymnospermous
    seeds. In the absence of proof of a connexion between this
    sporangium and <i>Botryopteris</i> it is convenient to use the
    generic name <i>Tracheotheca</i> subsequently proposed by Oliver<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>In the recent ferns <i>Helminthostachys</i> and <i>Botrychium</i>, and, as
    Oliver notices, in the microsporangia of the Australian Cycad
    <i>Bowenia spectabilis</i>, vascular strands extend almost to the
    sporogenous tissue, but the fossil sporangium is unique in
    having a tracheal layer in immediate contact with the spores.
    These xylem elements may, as Oliver suggests, have served the
    purpose of conveying water to the ripening spores.</p>

  <h6><i>Botryopteris hirsuta</i> (Will.)<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>.</h6>

  <p>This English species has a slender axis bearing numerous
    leaves with petioles equal in diameter to the stem. The surface
    of the vegetative organs bears large multicellular hairs. The
    leaf-traces resemble those of <i>B. forensis</i>, but the projecting teeth
    which terminate in protoxylem elements are less prominent
    than in the French species; the petioles were named by Felix
    <i>Rachiopteris tridentata</i><a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>. As a leaf-trace passes into the stele
    of the stem the three protoxylem strands unite and take up an
    internal position in the solid stele. The stele may, therefore,
    be described as endarch. The small tracheae at the edge of
    the stele supply the xylem strands of adventitious roots.</p>

  <p>Sporangia similar to those of <i>B. forensis</i> have been found in
    association with the English species.</p>

  <h6><i>Botryopteris cylindrica</i> (Will.). Fig. 305.</h6>

  <p>A plant originally described by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> from the Lower
    Coal-Measures of England as <i>Rachiopteris cylindrica</i> (<a href="#fig305">fig. 305</a>)
    and afterwards more fully dealt with by Hick<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>, has a slender
    stem with a cylindrical stele characterised by well-defined
    central protoxylem elements in one or two groups. The leaf-traces
    are semi-lunar in section with the protoxylem on the
    flatter side. The stele of <i>Botryopteris cylindrica</i> (<a href="#fig305">fig. 305</a>, A)
    is more cylindrical in section than that of <i>B. ramosa</i> (<a href="#fig306">fig. 306</a>)
    and shows more clearly the differentiation into smaller central
    and larger peripheral tracheae. In the section reproduced in
    <a href="#fig305">fig. 305</a>, B the stele is giving off a branch almost identical in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>structure with the main vascular axis. Scott<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>, in referring to
    the inclusion of this type in the genus <i>Botryopteris</i>, expresses
    the opinion that its habit must have been very different from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>that of other species, and he suggests the institution of a new
    genus.</p>

  <h6><i>Botryopteris ramosa</i> (Williamson). Fig. 306.</h6>

  <p>This species, which bears a close resemblance to <i>Botryopteris
      hirsuta</i>, was originally described by Williamson from the Lower
    Coal-Measures of England as <i>Rachiopteris ramosa</i><a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>, the specific
    name being chosen on account of the numerous and crowded
    branches given off from the main axis. The section shown in
    <a href="#fig306">fig. 306</a>, A, illustrates Williamson’s description of the stem as
    being “always surrounded [when seen in transverse sections]
    by a swarm of similar sections of the large and small branches,
    though of varying shapes and sizes.” The stele is composed of
    a solid and more or less cylindrical rod of xylem tracheae of
    the reticulate type surrounded by phloem (figs. A and D): one
    or more internal groups of smaller protoxylem elements occur
    in an approximately central position (fig. A, <i>px</i>). The stele is
    in fact endarch like those of <i>Selaginella spinosa</i> and <i>Trichomanes
    reniforme</i>, a feature which, as Tansley<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> believes, probably
    entitles the vascular axis to be considered a primitive form of
    protostele. In the specimens represented in <a href="#fig306">fig. 306</a> the phloem
    and inner cortical tissues were almost completely destroyed
    before petrifaction. The thick-walled outer cortex bears at its
    periphery numerous multicellular hairs. Some of the xylem
    strands given off from the stele no doubt supplied adventitious
    roots, but in most cases the outgoing branches are leaf-traces
    and the numerous sections of axes of different sizes seen in
    fig. A point to a repeated subdivision of the crowded fronds.
    The structure of a petiole is shown in figs. C and D. As seen
    in fig. C, the oval vascular strand has three protoxylem groups,
    <i>px</i>, on its flatter side; a well-defined epidermal layer is shown
    at <i>e</i> in fig. C.</p>

  <p>Fig. B shows at <i>a</i> a section of a leaf-axis in the act of
    branching and the row of branchlets at <i>b</i> represents a further
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>stage in subdivision. At <i>sp</i> in fig. A the section has cut
    through a single sporangium characterised by a group of larger
    (“annulus”) cells on one side of the wall.</p>

  <h6><i>Botryopteris antiqua</i>, Kidst. Fig. 307.</h6>

  <p>This species, recently described by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> from the Culm
    of Pettycur near Burntisland, is represented by sections of a
    small stem with a cylindrical stele 0·40 mm. in diameter composed
    entirely of scalariform tracheae without any recognisable
    protoxylem. The petioles are larger than the stem; the
    meristele (<a href="#fig307">fig. 307</a>) is oval with protoxylem elements on the
    slightly more rounded adaxial face. As Kidston suggests, this
    stem may belong to a scrambling plant which required support
    to bear its relatively large leaves. An interesting feature is
    the absence of projecting teeth in the leaf-trace, a character in
    marked contrast to the ω form assumed by the petioles of
    <i>Botryopteris forensis</i> (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>, G) and <i>B. hirsuta</i>. This leads
    Kidston to suggest that the vascular strand of the petiole
    tends “to become more simple ... as traced back in geological
    time.” The greater similarity in this species between the stele
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>of the stem and that of the petiole is probably another mark
    of a more primitive type.</p>

  <p>In these three types, <i>Grammatopteris</i>, <i>Tubicaulis</i>, and <i>Botryopteris</i>,
    we have monostelic plants, for the most part of very small
    size, with leaf-traces varying in shape from the oblong band-form
    in <i>Grammatopteris</i>, and the oval form of <i>Botryopteris antiqua</i>, to
    the ω type represented in its most pronounced form by <i>B. forensis</i>.
    In several species the stem stele is endarch. Our knowledge
    of the leaves is very meagre: in <i>B. forensis</i> they were repeatedly
    branched and apparently bore small fleshy pinnules; the sporangia,
    though differing from those of recent ferns, may be
    compared with the spore-capsules of Osmundaceae as regards
    the structure of the annulus. The abundance of hairs on the
    stems and leaves of some species, the tracheal sheath in the
    sporangium described by Oliver<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> as <i>Tracheotheca</i> (= <i>Botryopteris?</i>),
    and the apparent absence of a large well-developed lamina,
    may perhaps be regarded as evidence of xerophilous conditions.</p>

  <h3 id="Zygoptereae">II. Zygoptereae.</h3>

  <p>Corda<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> proposed the generic name <i>Zygopteris</i> for petrified
    petioles from the Permian of Saxony, included by Cotta in his
    genus <i>Tubicaulis</i>, which he named <i>T. primarius</i>. Corda’s genus
    has been generally used for petioles of Palaeozoic ferns characterised
    by a vascular strand having the form of an <b>H</b> in
    transverse section (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, D). Since the generic name was
    instituted, information has been obtained in regard to the
    nature of the stems which bore some of the petioles of the
    <i>Zygopteris</i> type; and for other species of <i>Zygopteris</i>, the stems
    of which are still unknown, new generic names have been
    proposed. P. Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> retains <i>Zygopteris</i> for one species only,
    <i>Z. primaria</i>. Fig. 308, D, shows the character of the petiolar
    vascular strand; the chief points are the comparatively long
    cross-pieces (antennae of P. Bertrand) inclined at an angle of
    45° to the plane of symmetry of the petiole axis, and the groups
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>of protoxylem elements shown by the white patches in fig. D.
    In this as in other members of the Zygoptereae the main rachis
    of the leaf gives off four sets of branches in pairs alternately
    from the right and left side of the primary vascular axis. This
    method of branching of the stele in the primary rachis of
    several members of the Coenopterideae shows that the fronds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
    bore pinnae laterally disposed, in some cases in one row and in
    others in two rows on each side of the rachis. In a typical fern
    frond, as represented by recent and most fossil species, branching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
    of the rachis occurs in the plane of the frond, that is in the
    plane represented by the horizontal arm of xylem in <i>Zygopteris
      primaria</i> connecting the two antennae or cross-pieces. In the
    Zygoptereae the branches from the petiole vascular axis lie in
    a plane at right angles to that of the frond; they lie in the
    transverse and not in the horizontal plane. The two strands
    shown in <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, B, 4, have been formed by the division of a
    single strand, 3, in the transverse plane (i.e. in the plane of the
    paper). As Tansley<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> points out, a type of branching superficially
    similar to, though not identical with this, is seen in
    some recent species of <i>Gleichenia</i> and <i>Lygodium</i>. In this
    connexion it is worthy of note that a fern figured by Unger
    from Thuringia as <i>Sphenopteris petiolata</i> Goepp<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> bears pinnae
    in two rows on the rachis which are characterised by repeated
    branching and by a very narrow lamina or by slender naked
    axes; the occurrence of this form of frond in rocks containing
    <i>Clepsydropsis antiqua</i> (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, A) suggests a possible
    connexion between the petrified rachis and the impressions of
    the leaves.</p>

  <p>The vascular strand of the rachis of <i>Zygopteris primaria</i>
    (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, D) is simpler than that of most of the Zygoptereae
    and exhibits a close resemblance to the type of strand described
    by Renault as <i>Diplolabis</i> (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, C).</p>

  <h5><i>Diplolabis.</i></h5>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> instituted this genus for two species from the
    Culm beds and Coal-Measures of France based on the structure
    of the petioles. The stems are unknown. The main rachis
    has a stele similar to that of <i>Zygopteris primaria</i>, but distinguished
    by its greater similarity, in transverse section, to
    an <b>X</b> rather than to the letter <b>H</b>: the long transverse bar in
    <i>Zygopteris</i> is here much reduced in size. The petiole of
    <i>Diplolabis forensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> Ren. (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, C) has a diameter of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>1·5–2 cm. From the antennae a pair of small bundles is
    given off alternately from the right and left side, as in
    <i>Zygopteris</i>; the members of each pair coalesce after leaving
    the antennae and then separate to pass into the lateral
    branches of the frond. The position of the protoxylem and
    the formation of the lateral xylem strands previous to their
    separation are shown in <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, C. On the side of the
    vascular strand shown in fig. C, 2, the two lateral extensions
    of the antennae are converging towards one another previous
    to their separation and subsequent union. The ovoid sporangia
    occur in groups of three to six and are coalescent below with a
    central receptacle; they have no annulus, but the cells on the
    side next the receptacle are smaller than those on the external
    wall (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, A). The synangial form of the sorus suggests
    comparison with Marattiaceae.</p>

  <p>The species described by Renault from the Culm of Esnost
    is regarded by P. Bertrand as identical with that described by
    Solms, from the Culm of Falkenberg, as <i>Zygopteris Roemeri</i><a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>.
    <i>Diplolabis</i> is compared by P. Bertrand with <i>Metaclepsydropsis</i>,
    the generic name given to the Lower Carboniferous petiole
    described by Williamson as <i>Rachiopteris duplex</i><a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>.</p>

  <p>Mr Gordon has recently described in a preliminary note a
    new type of stem stele under the name <i>Zygopteris pettycurensis</i>
    from the Lower Carboniferous plant bed of Pettycur<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>: he regards
    the petioles attached to the stem as identical with <i>Zygopteris
    Roemeri</i> Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>. This species, founded by Solms-Laubach
    on petioles only, is placed by Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> in the genus
    <i>Diplolabis</i> and regarded as identical with <i>D. esnostensis</i> Ren.
    The stele found by Mr Gordon may therefore be assigned to the
    genus <i>Diplolabis</i>: it includes two regions composed exclusively
    of tracheae and is cylindrical in transverse section. The inner
    xylem zone consists of short, square-ended, reticulately pitted
    elements and the outer zone is composed of long and pointed
    conducting tracheae. The scalariform protoxylem elements are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>situated between the two metaxylem zones. As Mr Gordon
    says: this type of stem occupies a position “in the Zygopteroid
    alliance” corresponding to that which <i>Thamnopteris Schlechtendalii</i>
    (p. 329) occupies in the Osmundaceous series. The
    discovery of this stem supplies another link between the two
    fern groups, Osmundaceae and Coenopterideae. Pelourde<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> has
    described an imperfectly preserved vascular strand from a
    locality near Autun as the type of a new genus <i>Flicheia esnostensis</i>.
    Mr Gordon has pointed out to me that this is a partially rotted
    petiole of <i>Diplolabis esnostensis</i> (= <i>Zygopteris Roemeri</i>).</p>

  <p>In their recent account of fossil Osmundaceous genera, Kidston
    and Gwynne-Vaughan<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> speak of the central parenchyma of
    the existing medullated stele as being derived from tracheal
    tissue. They add that if the Zygopteroid line of descent is at
    all close to the Osmundaceous, we must be prepared for the
    existence of a <i>Zygopteris</i> with a solid xylem like that of
    <i>Thamnopteris</i>: “such a discovery, in fact, we hopefully anticipate<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>.”
    The new Pettycur stem amply justifies this prophecy.
    It is noteworthy that Mr Gordon’s stem affords an instance of
    the occurrence of a type of stele, similar in its cylindrical form
    and in the absence of parenchyma to that of <i>Botryopteris</i>, in a
    plant bearing leaves characterised by the <i>Zygopteris</i> type of
    vascular strand.</p>

  <h6><i>Metaclepsydropsis duplex</i> (Will.) <a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, A<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>. [= <i>Rachiopteris
    duplex</i>, Williamson 1874. <i>Asterochlaena</i> (<i>Clepsydropsis</i>)
    <i>duplex</i>, Stenzel 1889. <i>Clepsydropsis</i>, Renault 1896.]</h6>

  <p>The vascular axis of the main axis of the frond is characterised
    by the hour-glass shape of the xylem which consists
    entirely of tracheae, most of which are reticulately pitted. In
    a transverse section (<a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, A) the two ends of the stele are
    dissimilar; at one end of the long axis is a small bay of thin-walled
    tissue (phloem) enclosed by a narrow band of xylem, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>at the other the bay is open and has two protoxylem groups.
    The latter represents the earliest stage in the production of
    secondary bundles: at a later stage the bay is closed by the
    elongation of the edges, the enclosed group of phloem is
    vertically extended, and the protoxylem strands are more
    widely separated. The curved band of xylem becomes detached
    as a curved arc and divides into two (<a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, A). In
    a single section of this species one often sees several strands of
    xylem enclosed in a common cortex with the main vascular
    axis; these are the xylem bundles of lateral pinnae. <i>Metaclepsydropsis
      duplex</i> shows the method of branching of the
    petiole vascular axis which has already been noticed in <i>Diplolabis</i>
    and <i>Zygopteris</i>. In reference to this feature, Williamson
    wrote in 1872—“I know of no recent fern in which the secondary
    branches of the petiole are thus given off in pairs, which pairs
    are distichously arranged on the primary axis, and each of
    which secondary petioles sustains ternary ones arranged distichously.”
    By slightly altering the primary stele of this type
    of frond, by narrowing of the constricted portion of the hour-glass
    and extending the lateral groups of xylem obliquely
    upwards, the form of stele shown in <a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, A, would be
    converted into the <i>Diplolabis</i> type (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, C).</p>

  <h5><i>Clepsydropsis.</i></h5>

  <p>Unger<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> instituted this genus as a subdivision of Corda’s
    family Rhaciopterideae<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>, the name having reference to the
    hour-glass form of the vascular axis<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>. The type-species
    <i>C. antiqua</i> (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, A) is spoken of as the commonest fossil
    plant in the Devonian rocks of Thuringia. In some sections
    the xylem has the form seen in <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, A, in which an
    invagination of thin-walled tissue occurs at each end; in
    other sections (<a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, A′) the bays become islands in the
    xylem. Solms-Laubach speaks of Unger’s species as <i>Rachiopteris</i>
    (<i>Clepsydropsis</i>) <i>antiqua</i>. P. Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>, who has recently
    described Unger’s plant, while recognising that <i>C. antiqua</i> and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span><i>Metaclepsydropsis duplex</i> closely resemble one another, draws
    attention to certain differences in the structure of the xylem
    which he regards as sufficient to justify a generic separation.
    The leaf-traces of <i>Clepsydropsis</i> are described by Bertrand as
    almost circular closed rings of xylem instead of an arc as in
    <i>Metaclepsydropsis</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Ankyropteris.</i></h5>

  <p>Stenzel adopted this name for a subdivision of Corda’s genus
    <i>Zygopteris</i>, applying it to a species described by Renault as
    <i>Z. Brongniarti</i>, to a Permian species described by himself as
    <i>Z.</i> (<i>Ankyropteris</i>) <i>scandens</i>, and to <i>Z. Lacattii</i> Ren.; <i>Rachiopteris
    Grayi</i> Will. and <i>Rachiopteris corrugata</i> Will. are also
    included in this genus. The characters emphasised by Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>are (i) the double anchor-like form of the <b>H</b>-shaped petiole
    strand in which the lateral arms (antennae) are curved like the
    flukes of an anchor, and (ii) the emission of four rows of branches
    instead of two. The latter distinguishing feature no longer
    holds good, as <i>Z. primaria</i> also gives off four rows of bundles
    and not two as Stenzel supposed. P. Bertrand has adopted
    Stenzel’s genus in a narrower sense<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>.</p>

  <h6><i>Ankyropteris scandens</i> Stenzel<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>. Fig. 310, D.</h6>

  <p>This Lower Permian species is very similar to or perhaps
    identical with <i>Ankyropteris Grayi</i> (Williamson). The stem of</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span></p>

  <p><i>A. scandens</i> was found in association with the roots of a
    <i>Psaronius</i> stem evidently petrified <i>in situ</i> as it burrowed,
    like <i>Tmesipteris</i>, tropical aroids, and other recent plants, among
    the living roots of the tree-fern. The stem, 10–11 mm.
    in diameter, bore fronds with an <b>H</b>-shaped vascular strand,
    small scale-leaves, and adventitious roots. The stele consists
    of a five-angled cylinder of scalariform tracheae surrounding an
    axial strand of parenchyma containing scattered tracheae of
    smaller diameter. This axial tissue extends as a narrow strip
    into each of the short and obtusely truncated arms (cf. <a href="#fig311">fig. 311</a>).
    A striking feature is the production of a shoot in the axil of the
    foliage-leaves (<a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, D), a manner of branching characteristic
    of <i>Trichomanes</i> (see <a href="#Page_365">page 365</a>).</p>

  <h6><i>Ankyropteris Grayi</i> (Will.). Fig. 311.</h6>

  <p>In describing this species, Williamson wrote—“That no
    classification of these fossil ferns based solely upon transverse
    sections of the petiolar bundles is or can be of much value, is
    clearly shown when tested amongst those living ferns the
    classification of which is chiefly based upon the sporangial
    reproductive organs<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>.” This is a view entirely opposed to that
    which inspires P. Bertrand’s recent monograph. Whether the
    value attached to the vascular structure of petioles as a basis
    of classification is upheld or not, it is noteworthy that since
    Williamson expressed his opinion, our knowledge of the anatomy
    of ferns and of the value of anatomical evidence has enormously
    increased. The slender stem<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> of this Lower Coal-Measures
    species agrees closely with that of <i>A. scandens</i>; it bore spirally
    disposed fronds, scale-leaves, and roots. The stele has the form
    of an irregular five-rayed star (<a href="#fig311">fig. 311</a>) in which the relative
    length of the arms varies in different sections owing to the
    separation of the distal ends to form leaf-traces. The axial
    region is composed of parenchyma and associated narrow
    tracheae, as in <i>A. scandens</i>. The xylem, with protoxylem
    elements at the ends and especially at the angles of the arms,
    is completely surrounded by phloem. The cortex consists
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>internally of parenchyma which becomes thicker-walled towards
    the periphery and bears multicellular epidermal hairs. A leaf-trace
    is detached in the form of a triangular strand and is
    formed by the tangential extension of the distal end of an arm
    of the stele. The trace, on its way through the cortex, divides
    into two; the outer branch gradually changes from a slightly
    curved band to an <b>H</b>-shaped meristele; the inner branch,
    which supplied an axillary shoot, is similar to the stele of the
    stem, but smaller. Scott<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> has recently recorded the occurrence
    of scale-leaves (aphlebiae) in this species like those described by
    Stenzel in <i>A. scandens</i>.</p>

  <p>The section reproduced in <a href="#fig313">fig. 313</a> shows the characteristic
    form of the petiolar vascular axis, consisting of a horizontal
    band of metaxylem with groups of much smaller tracheae on
    both the upper and lower margins. At the junction between
    the antennae, curved like the flukes of an anchor, and the
    horizontal band of xylem, the latter is only one trachea in
    breadth. The narrow loops of smaller xylem elements are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>shown on the outer edge, <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig313">fig. 313</a>), of the antennae separated
    from the arcs of larger tracheae by a dark line which represents
    a crushed band of delicate tissue. The spaces enclosed by the
    incurved antennae are largely occupied by parenchymatous
    ground-tissue. The cylinder of outer cortex consists internally of
    comparatively thin-walled parenchyma succeeded externally by
    a zone of dark and thicker-walled cells characterised by a fairly
    regular arrangement in radial series, as if formed by a secondary
    meristem; there is, however, no indication of a meristematic
    layer. Below the small-celled epidermis are a few layers of
    thinner-walled cells which are not arranged in radial series.
    The structure of the outer part of the cortex is similar to that
    in the petiole of recent species of <i>Angiopteris</i> (<a href="#fig243">fig. 243</a>, p. 319)
    and <i>Marattia</i>, in which a more delicate hypoderm is succeeded
    by a band of mechanical tissue.</p>

  <p>The rachis of this type of frond gives off two rows of lateral
    branches from the vascular axis, the plane of symmetry being
    at right angles to the primary rachis. Each pinna bore at its
    base two aphlebiae supplied with vascular strands from the
    leaf-traces.</p>

  <p>We have no certain information in regard to the sporangia
    of this species, but Scott points out that “pear-shaped sporangia,
    with a very broad and extensive annulus, are commonly found
    associated with <i>Zygopteris bibractensis</i> and <i>Z. corrugata</i> in the
    petrifactions of the English Lower Coal-Measures<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>.”</p>

  <h6><i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> (Will.). Figs. <a href="#fig312">312</a>, B; <a href="#fig314">314–317</a>.</h6>

  <p>The stem of this type of Zygoptereae was described by
    Williamson from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire as
    <i>Rachiopteris corrugata</i> and included by him in the sub-group
    Anachoropteroides. The stele (<a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, B) is oval in transverse
    section; it consists of a cylinder of xylem tracheae enclosing a
    central region occupied by parenchymatous tissue and scattered
    narrow scalariform tracheae. The central tissue extends radially
    in the form of narrow arms which reach almost to the outer
    edge of the tracheal tissue and divide it up into 5–7 groups.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>A cylinder of thin-walled tissue encloses the xylem and in this
    occur groups of large sieve-tubes (<a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, D, <i>Sv</i>).</p>

  <p>In a section of this species in the Williamson Collection<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>
    the long axis of the stele has a length of 5 mm. and the
    diameter of the stem as a whole is 2·5 cm. The greater part
    of the extra-stelar tissue consists of large parenchymatous cells
    passing near the periphery into a band of darker and thicker-walled
    tissue.</p>

  <p>Reniform vascular strands traverse the cortex in an obliquely
    ascending course on their way to the leaves, also smaller bundles,
    some of which are given off directly from the stele, while others
    are branches of the petiole vascular strands. The petioles
    described by Williamson as <i>Rachiopteris insignis</i><a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> were afterwards
    recognised by him as those of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i>,
    though this conclusion was not published<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>. Williamson’s
    species <i>R. insignis</i> must not be confused with Unger’s Culm
    species <i>Arctopodium insigne</i>, which Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> refers to as
    <i>Rachiopteris insignis</i>. The leaf-bundle of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i>
    is at first reniform in contour (<a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, C, <i>P</i>), but as it
    becomes free from the stem it gradually assumes the <b>H</b>-shaped
    form (<a href="#fig315">figs. 315–317</a>). This petiolar strand differs from that of
    <i>Ankyropteris bibractensis</i> (<a href="#fig313">fig. 313</a>) in the shorter and less
    strongly curved antennae; and, as Williamson first noticed, the
    tracheae are frequently filled with thin-walled parenchyma
    (<a href="#fig312">fig. 312</a>, B). The existence of scale-leaves or aphlebiae like
    those of <i>Ankyropteris scandens</i> and <i>A. Grayi</i> has been recorded
    by Scott in <i>A. corrugata</i><a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>.</p>

  <p>The section represented in <a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, C, shows the relatively
    small size of the stele <i>S</i> in the stem of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i>.
    The main mass of the cortex consists of uniform parenchyma
    passing near the surface into darker and stronger tissue: two
    vascular bundles are shown in the cortex, one of which forms
    the conducting strand of a petiole, <i>P</i>, which has nearly freed
    itself from the stem: the other bundle, as shown by the
    examination of a series of sections, eventually passes into
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>another leaf-stalk. A root of another plant has invaded the
    cortex at <i>R</i>, <a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, C.</p>

  <p>The form and structure of the stele is diagrammatically
    represented in <a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>, B. The outer portion (black) consists
    of a cylinder of scalariform tracheae in which the position of
    groups of smaller elements (protoxylem) is shown by the white
    patches. The xylem is thus seen to be mesarch. The prominent
    group of xylem on the lower right-hand side of the section<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
    consists of tracheae, cut across in an oblique direction, which are
    about to pass out as a separate strand. The centre of the stele
    is occupied by parenchymatous tissue in which are included
    scattered tracheae, either singly or in small groups. These
    medullary tracheae are rather narrower than those of the main
    xylem cylinder. A characteristic feature is the radial outward
    extension into the xylem of the medullary parenchyma, which
    tends partially to divide the tracheal cylinder into broad groups.</p>

  <p>Fig. 314, A, enlarged from fig. B, <i>a</i>, shows the mesarch
    position of a protoxylem group, and a few of the parenchymatous
    cells of one of the narrow arms of the axial tissue. At
    <i>Sv</i> in fig. D a group of large sieve-tubes is seen separated from
    the xylem by a few parenchymatous cells, and beyond the
    sieve-tubes are some tangentially elongated cells. Both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
    sieve-tubes, <i>Sv</i>, and the flattened cells resemble tissues in a
    corresponding position in the steles of modern Osmundaceae.</p>

  <p>In a section of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> in the Williamson
    Collection the radial arrangement of the more external metaxylem
    elements suggests the addition of secondary tracheae<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>.
    This suggestion of secondary thickening, a point which requires
    much more thorough investigation, is interesting in relation to
    a new type of stem named by Scott <i>Botrychioxylon</i><a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>, but not
    yet fully described. This generic name has been given to
    a stem stele which closely resembles that of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i>
    except in the regular radial arrangement of the peripheral
    xylem elements. The name <i>Botrychioxylon</i> was chosen by Scott
    because of the secondary xylem characteristic of the recent
    genus <i>Botrychium</i> (<a href="#fig247">fig. 247</a>, p. 322).</p>

  <p>In the petiolar vascular strand represented in <a href="#fig315">fig. 315</a> the
    narrow band of tracheae which forms a loop external to the
    antennae is clearly seen, also the small-celled parenchyma
    between the loops and the larger metaxylem elements of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>antennae. The crushed tissue lying on the outer face of each
    of the loops probably represents the phloem and pericycle; the
    thin-walled elements above and below the horizontal band of
    metaxylem are probably sieve-tubes.</p>

  <p>Fig. 316 shows a transverse section of a petiole of this
    species: the loops, <i>a</i>, of small tracheae are seen bending round
    the outer edge of the antennae. The inner and more delicate
    cortical tissue is partially preserved and spaces, <i>b</i>, have been
    formed in it as the result of contraction previous to petrifaction.
    In the petiole represented in <a href="#fig317">fig. 317</a> the tracheae of the
    horizontal band are considerably crushed; the section is, however,
    of interest because of the presence of <i>Lyginodendron</i>
    roots, <i>l</i>, in the space originally occupied by the inner cortex.</p>

  <p>In a paper on the tyloses of <i>Rachiopteris corrugata</i>, Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>
    draws attention to the fact that similar inclusions have not
    been found in the tracheae of recent ferns. The occurrence of
    thin-walled parenchymatous cells in the large tracheae of
    <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> petioles and of other species is a
    striking feature. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> compared these cells with the
    tyloses in the vessels of recent flowering plants, and in a later
    paper<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> he suggested that the included cells may belong to
    saprophytic or parasitic fungi. It is, as Weiss points out,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>difficult to explain the occurrence of tyloses in tracheae not
    immediately in contact with living parenchyma. It may be
    that the pits in the tracheae of <i>Ankyropteris</i> were open spaces
    as in the xylem of recent ferns described by Gwynne-Vaughan,
    and if so this would facilitate the invasion of the conducting
    elements by growing cells. A comparison is made by Weiss
    between certain cell-groups found by him in the tracheae of
    <i>Ankyropteris</i> and by Miss Jordan<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> in the vessels of the recent
    dicotyledon <i>Cucumis sativus</i>. In a more recent paper on
    tyloses Miss McNicol<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> expresses the opinion that pseudoparenchyma
    in the tracheae of the fossil petioles owes its origin
    to fungal hyphae.</p>

  <p>Williamson compared the petiole bundles of <i>Ankyropteris
    corrugata</i> with those of recent Osmundaceae, a comparison
    based on the structure of the leaf-trace before its separation
    from the stem and its assumption of the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-form. It is
    noteworthy, however, that this comparison has acquired a
    greater significance as the result of recent work. The stele
    of <i>Ankyropteris</i> bears a fairly close resemblance to that of
    <i>Zalesskya</i> described by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan; in
    both types the xylem is represented by two kinds of tracheal
    tissue. In the Permian Osmundaceous genus the centre of
    the stele consists of short storage tracheids, while in <i>Ankyropteris</i>
    we may regard the central parenchyma and scattered
    tracheae as derivatives of the solid xylem core of some ancestral
    type. Moreover, the appearance and arrangement of the phloem
    and the tangentially elongated elements external to it (<a href="#fig314">fig. 314</a>)
    remind one of the extra-xylem zone in recent Osmundaceae.
    That the Osmundaceae and Zygoptereae are closely related
    groups there can be little doubt; of this affinity and common
    origin<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> affords striking evidence.</p>

  <p>The difference between the steles of <i>Ankyropteris Grayi</i>
    and <i>A. scandens</i> (figs. <a href="#fig310">310</a>, D; <a href="#fig311">311</a>) and that of <i>Ankyropteris
    corrugata</i> is comparatively small. In the two former species
    the cylindrical form has become stellate owing to the radial
    extension of the xylem arms. It may be that this more
    elaborate style of vascular construction is connected with the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>climbing habit of <i>A. scandens</i> and possibly <i>A. Grayi</i>. The
    radial extension of the xylem and the consequent alternation of
    the yielding parenchymatous cortex and the more rigid tracheal
    arms would probably render the water-conducting elements less
    liable to injury in a twisting axis<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>. In <i>Anachoropteris Decaisnii</i><a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>,
    described by Renault, and more especially in <i>Asterochlaena
      laxa</i><a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> Stenzel, a Lower Permian type from Saxony
    (<a href="#fig324">fig. 324</a>), the xylem of the stele is much more deeply lobed
    than in <i>Ankyropteris Grayi</i> or <i>A. scandens</i>.</p>

  <p>P. Bertrand has proposed this name for a species of petiole
    from the Lower Coal-Measures of England referred by Binney<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>
    to <i>Zygopteris Lacattii</i> Ren., and included by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> in
    his comprehensive genus <i>Rachiopteris</i>. Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> regards the
    English species, which is recorded also from Germany<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>, as
    distinct from Renault’s type<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> and therefore proposes a new
    name. The petiole stele has the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-form, but its structure
    is simpler than that of the <i>Ankyropteris</i> petiole.</p>

  <p>The horizontal band of xylem has at each end two oval
    groups of tracheae connected with it by a single row of xylem
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>elements (<a href="#fig318">fig. 318</a>). From the lower part of each oval group
    a small strand is detached; the two strands from one side of
    the stele coalesce and then separate to pass into two pinnae.
    Fig. 308, B, shows four stages in the giving-off of the secondary
    branches. This species, therefore, produces four rows of branches
    in alternate pairs from the right and left sides of the petiole.</p>

  <p>The first stage is shown at 0, 0, <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, B; the two
    projecting groups of protoxylem mark the points of departure
    of a pair of small strands. At 1, the projections are more
    prominent, and at 2 a pair of strands has become detached: at
    a later stage, 3, these two strands unite to divide later (4) into
    two slightly curved bundles.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the fructification of <i>Etapteris</i> is based on
    Renault’s account of sporangia, which he regarded as belonging
    to <i>Zygopteris</i> (<i>Etapteris</i>) <i>Lacattii</i>. They have the form of
    elongated slightly curved sacs (2·5 × 1·3 mm.) borne in clusters
    (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>, A–C) on slender ramifications of the fertile frond,
    which is characterised by the absence of a lamina. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
    sporangium has a pedicel, and three to eight sporangia are
    attached to a common peduncle; the walls of the sporangia are
    at least two cell-layers in thickness and the annulus consists of
    a band of thick-walled cells passing from the crest down each
    side (figs. B and C), thus differing from the sporangia of <i>Botryopteris</i>
    (<a href="#fig319">fig. 319</a>, D, F) in which the broad annulus is confined to
    one side.</p>

  <p>It is practically certain that the fronds described by
    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> as <i>Schizopteris pinnata</i> (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, E) and <i>Schizostachys
    frondosus</i> represent respectively the sterile and fertile
    leaves of <i>Etapteris</i>. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> gives expression to this by substituting
    the generic name <i>Zygopteris</i> for <i>Schizopteris</i>, and we may
    now speak of the leaves as <i>Etapteris</i>. Dr White<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> has referred
    to a new genus, <i>Brittsia</i>, some impressions of pinnate fronds
    from the Coal-Measures of Missouri which, as he points out,
    bear a close resemblance to <i>Schizopteris pinnata</i> Grand’Eury
    (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, E). No sporangia have been found; it is, however,
    probable that <i>Brittsia problematica</i> represents fragments of a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>leaf borne by a plant closely allied to <i>Etapteris</i> (<i>Zygopteris</i>).
    The broad rachis bears crowded pinnae given off at a wide
    angle; the small pinnules are rather deeply lobed or pinnatifid
    (3–10 mm. long by 1·5–3 mm. broad). The lamina
    is traversed by irregularly lobed and occasionally anastomosing
    veins. In the fertile pinnae the segments have no lamina but
    bear bundles of pedicellate sporangia.</p>

  <p>It should be noticed that the sporangia described by
    Renault and by other authors as those of <i>Zygopteris</i> (fig.
    319, A–C) have not been found in organic continuity with
    a frond showing a well-preserved vascular strand. It is, however,
    certain that this characteristic annulate sporangium, borne on
    branched and slender pedicels, was produced on fronds with
    a much reduced lamina belonging to some species of the
    Zygoptereae, <i>Etapteris</i> and probably also <i>Ankyropteris</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Stauropteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This genus was instituted by Binney for petioles from the
    Lower Coal-Measures of Oldham (Lancashire).</p>

  <p><i>Stauropteris oldhamia</i> Binney<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> is characterised by a stele
    (figs. <a href="#fig308">308</a>, E–G; <a href="#fig310">310</a>, C; <a href="#fig320">320</a>; <a href="#fig321">321</a>) composed of four groups
    of xylem which Bertrand regards as homologous with the
    antennae of <i>Diplolabis</i>, <i>Ankyropteris</i>, and <i>Etapteris</i>, the horizontal
    cross-piece of these genera being absent in <i>Stauropteris</i>.
    Williamson spoke of this species as “one of the most beautiful
    and also one of the most perplexing of the plants of the Coal-Measures”;
    he discussed its possible affinity with both Lycopods
    and ferns, deciding in favour of the latter group<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>. In transverse
    section the petiolar vascular axis is approximately square, the
    xylem groups forming the ends of the diagonals; the tracheal
    groups are separated by phloem and the centre of the stele in
    the primary rachis is also occupied by that tissue, which is
    connected by four narrow strips with the external phloem. The
    structure of the petiolar vascular axis is very clearly shown in
    the drawing by Mrs Tansley reproduced in <a href="#fig320">fig. 320</a>. Protoxylem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
    elements occur close to the surface of each of the four
    arms of the xylem; the bays between the two lateral and the
    two lower xylem groups contain large sieve-tubes. Portions of
    the inner cortex are seen in places abutting on the small-celled
    pericyclic tissue.</p>

  <p>The right and left halves of the stele are not absolutely
    identical (<a href="#fig320">fig. 320</a>; <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, E); this is due to the fact that
    secondary branches are given off in four rows, two alternately
    from the right and left sides. The preparation for the departure
    of the lateral strands alters the configuration of the stelar xylem
    groups. The protoxylem groups are not external but separated
    from the surface by one or two layers of metaxylem. In <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, E,
    the occurrence of two protoxylem strands in the right-hand
    groups of metaxylem marks an early stage in the detachment
    of branches. These two protoxylems are the result of division
    of single protoxylem strands like those in the left-hand half of
    the stele. At a later stage the petiolar stele assumes the form
    shown in <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, F, and two small bundles are detached to supply
    aphlebiae: this is followed by the stage shown in fig. G, where
    two four-armed strands are passing out to a pair of branches of
    the leaf axis. The separation of these two meristeles leaves
    the right-hand half of the stele in the condition seen on the
    left-hand side of fig. E. The diagrammatic sketch represented
    in <a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, C, shows one pair of branches in organic connexion
    with the rachis, and each of these arms contains an obliquely
    cut vascular strand like those in <a href="#fig308">fig. 308</a>, G.</p>

  <p>The cortex consists for the most part of fairly thick-walled
    parenchyma (<a href="#fig321">fig. 321</a>) which in the hypodermal region is replaced
    by a zone of thin-walled lacunar tissue. A few stomata have
    been recognised in the epidermis<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>. The lower left-hand branch
    seen in <a href="#fig310">fig. 310</a>, C, has been shaved by the cutting wheel so
    that the aerenchymatous tissue, <i>l</i>, is shown in surface-view: a
    portion of this tissue is enlarged in fig. C′. The same delicate
    chlorophyllous tissue forms a folded and shrivelled layer with
    an uneven margin on the surface of the rachis and lateral
    branches. This hypha-like tissue, which was discovered by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>Scott<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> and figured by Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>, doubtless represents the
    much reduced lamina of the highly compound leaves; it may
    be compared with the green outer cortex of <i>Psilotum</i> shoots
    and with the lacunar tissue in the capsule of the common
    moss, <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The rachis reproduced in <a href="#fig321">fig. 321</a> is surrounded by an
    enormous number of sections, some transverse, others more or
    less vertical, of branchlets of various sizes. Fig. 310, B, shows
    the three-rayed vascular axis of a branch of a lower order than
    those seen in fig. C, and the single vascular strands of still finer
    ramifications of the leaf. The extraordinary abundance of axes
    of different sizes, many of which are cut in the plane of
    branching, in close association with the rachises of <i>Stauropteris</i>
    affords a striking demonstration of the extent to which the subdivision
    of the frond was carried in a small space. The leaves
    must have presented the appearance of a feathery plexus of
    delicate green branchlets devoid of a lamina, some of which
    bore terminal sporangia. It may be that the delicate fronds
    were borne on a slender rhizome which lived epiphytically in a
    moist atmosphere on the stouter stems of a supporting plant.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span></p>

  <p>The sporangia<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> of <i>Stauropteris oldhamia</i> are exannulate and
    nearly spherical, with a wall of more than a single row of cells;
    they occur at the tips of slender and doubtless pendulous
    branchlets. The discovery by Scott<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> of germinating spores
    (<a href="#fig323">fig. 323</a>) in a sporangium of this type supplies an interesting
    piece of evidence in favour of the fern nature of these reproductive
    organs. Similar germinating spores have been described
    by Boodle<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> in sporangia of <i>Todea</i>.</p>

  <h6><i>Stauropteris burntislandica.</i></h6>

  <p>This Lower Carboniferous plant identified by Williamson
    with the Oldham plant from the Lower Coal-Measures is
    referred by Bertrand to a distinct species. In the structure
    of the rachis stele it agrees closely with <i>Stauropteris oldhamia</i>;
    the main vascular strand gives off four rows of branches, two
    from each side, and aphlebiae were present at the common
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>base of each pair of pinnae. Mrs Scott<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>, who has recently
    described the sporangia of this species, speaks of one specimen
    in which germinating spores were found. The same author
    gives an account of some curious spindle-shaped bodies which
    she found in association with <i>S. burntislandica</i>. The nature
    of these organs is uncertain; Mrs Scott inclines to regard
    them as glands borne in pairs on lateral pedicels of the
    frond: she adopts for these the name <i>Bensonites fusiformis</i>
    proposed by Dr Scott. If there is a reasonable probability, as
    there certainly seems to be, in favour of connecting these organs
    with <i>Stauropteris</i>, it is legitimate to question the desirability
    of adding to the long list of names included in the group
    Coenopterideae.</p>

  <h5><i>Corynepteris.</i> Fig. 309, C, D.</h5>

  <p>This genus was founded by Baily<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> on fragments of a fern
    from Carboniferous rocks in County Limerick, Ireland, characterised
    by a peculiar type of fructification which he named
    <i>Corynepteris stellata</i>. More complete examples of the same
    genus have been described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> from the Coal-field of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>Valenciennes. The sporangia are large, ovoid, and sessile; the
    annulus (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, D) has the form of a complete vertical band
    several cells in breadth: five to ten sporangia are grouped
    round a receptacle. Zeiller describes two species as <i>Sphenopteris
    (Corynepteris) coralloides</i> Gutb. and <i>S. (Corynepteris)
    Essinghii</i> And.; in both the fronds are quadripinnate and bear
    aphlebiae at the base of the pinnae. The former species is
    recorded by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> from the South Wales Coal-field. A
    single pinnule of <i>C. coralloides</i> is shown in <a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, C. Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>
    refers this frond to his genus <i>Alloiopteris</i>: the portion of a
    pinna represented in <a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, G shows the characteristic modified
    pinnule next the rachis. Zeiller draws attention to the occurrence
    of two parallel lines on the rachis of a specimen of
    <i>Corynepteris coralloides</i> which he figures<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>, and suggests that
    these may indicate the existence of an <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-shaped form of
    vascular strand like that of <i>Etapteris</i> and <i>Ankyropteris</i>. The
    sorus of <i>Corynepteris</i> is comparable with that of the Marattiaceae,
    but the broad annulus is a difference which suggests
    affinity to <i>Etapteris</i>. The sorus is similar to that in <i>Diplolabis</i>
    (<a href="#fig309">fig. 309</a>, A), but in that genus the sporangia are exannulate.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The vascular axis in the stems of different members of the
    Coenopterideae assumes a variety of types. In <i>Botryopteris
    antiqua</i> the xylem forms a solid protostele in which no protoxylem
    strands have been recognised; in other species, e.g.
    <i>B. ramosa</i>, the cylindrical stele is similar to that of <i>Trichomanes
    radicans</i> (Hymenophyllaceae) in the more or less central
    position of the protoxylem. In <i>Botryopteris forensis</i> the
    protostele is said to be exarch. The probability is that the
    central Botryopteris type is the endarch protostele, a form of
    vascular axis which may be regarded as primitive. The leaf-traces
    of the Lower Carboniferous <i>Botryopteris antiqua</i> are simple
    oval strands differing but slightly from the cylindrical stele
    of the stem. In the Upper Carboniferous British species the
    petiolar vascular strand has become more specialised and
    farther removed from that of the stem; in <i>B. forensis</i> the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>distinction between leaf and stem steles is still more pronounced.
    It is perhaps legitimate to regard these types as representing
    an ascending series, the more primitive of which are distinguished
    by the greater similarity between leaf and stem,
    organs differentiated from a primitive thallus<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a>, that is from a
    vegetative body. Portions of this ultimately became specialised
    as lateral members or leaves, while a portion acquired the
    character of a radially constructed supporting axis or stem.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ANKYROPTERIS, ETC.</div>

  <p>The vascular strand characteristic of the Zygoptereae is
    represented by the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-shaped form as seen in <i>Ankyropteris
    corrugata</i> or in a more complex form in <i>A. bibractensis</i>. This
    style of strand may be regarded as a development from the
    simple strands of <i>Grammatopteris</i> and <i>Tubicaulis</i> or <i>Botryopteris
    antiqua</i> along other lines than those followed by
    <i>B. forensis</i>. The extension of the xylem in two symmetrically
    placed arms at the ends of the cross-piece of the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span> is correlated
    with the habit of branching of the leaf-system which forms one
    of the striking peculiarities of many of the Zygoptereae. The
    solid type of stele characteristic of the Botryoptereae is closely
    matched by that in the Lower Carboniferous stem discovered
    by Mr Gordon<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>. By the partial transformation of the central
    xylem region into parenchymatous tissue and the concentration
    of water-conducting elements in the peripheral region the
    style of <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i> was developed. The vascular
    strand of the older plant, which is of the <i>Diplolabis</i> type, may
    be regarded as a more primitive style than that of the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-form
    of petiole strand represented by <i>Ankyropteris corrugata</i>. A
    further stage in evolution is seen in the stem stele of <i>Ankyropteris
    Grayi</i> and <i>A. scandens</i>, both of which have the <span class="sans"><b>H</b></span>-form
    of meristele. This step in increasing complexity of stem stele,
    though probably connected with the increasing specialisation of
    the leaf-traces, as held by Mr Tansley, may also be associated
    with the development of a climbing habit. In <i>Asterochlaena
    laxa</i> Stenzel (<a href="#fig324">fig. 324</a>) and <i>A. ramosa</i> (Cotta)<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> the tendency
    towards a stellate expansion of the originally cylindrical form
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>of stele reaches a higher degree, with the result that a style is
    evolved which agrees closely with that of the conducting tissue
    of some existing Dicotyledonous Lianes.</p>

  <p>Attention has already been drawn to the generalised features
    exhibited by the Coenopterideae both in the anatomy of the
    steles and in the structure of the sporangia. The conclusion
    arrived at is that while the Coenopterideae foreshadow in some
    of their characters more than one group of more recent ferns,
    some at least of their members afford convincing evidence of
    the correctness of the view—which is also that of Dr Kidston
    and Mr Gwynne-Vaughan—that the Osmundaceae and the
    Coenopterideae are offshoots of a common stock.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> unsatisfactory and meagre records in regard to the past
    history of these heterosporous Filicales render superfluous more
    than a brief reference to the recent species.</p>

  <h4 id="Marsiliaceae">Marsiliaceae.</h4>

  <p>This family is usually spoken of as including the two genera
    <i>Marsilia</i> and <i>Pilularia</i>. Lindman<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> has however founded a
    third genus, <i>Regnellidium</i>, on a Brazilian plant which is distinguished
    by some well-defined characters from all species of
    <i>Marsilia</i>. The members of the Marsiliaceae live for the most
    part in swampy situations. <i>Marsilia</i> is represented in Europe
    by <i>M. quadrifoliata</i> L. which occurs in Portugal, France,
    Germany and other parts of the Continent, extending also
    to Kashmir, Northern China, and Japan. Of the other 53
    species, 17 are recorded from different regions in Africa, while
    others occur in South America, Asia<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>, Australia, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p><i>Pilularia globulifera</i> L. is the only British representative
    of the Hydropterideae. The remaining four species of the genus
    occur in South America, California, New Zealand, Australia,
    and <i>P. minuta</i> Dur. is met with in the South of France, Algeria,
    and Asia Minor in subtropical or warm temperate regions.</p>

  <p>The Marsiliaceae are regarded as more nearly related to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>Schizaeaceae than to any other family of homosporous ferns<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>.
    Their heterospory, the production of sporangia in closed fruit-like
    sporocarps, and the anatomical features associated with
    existence in marshy habitats, tend to obscure the resemblances
    to the true ferns.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Marsilidium</i> proposed by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> for a piece of
    an axis, bearing apparently a whorl of six leaflets, from the
    Wealden of Osterwald, cannot be regarded as satisfactory
    evidence of the existence of the Marsiliaceae in the Wealden
    flora of North Germany.</p>

  <p>The six leaflets of <i>Marsilidium speciosum</i>, having a length
    of 5 cm., are similar in shape to the four leaflets of recent
    species of <i>Marsilia</i>, but they differ in the repeated dichotomy
    of the veins from the reticulate venation of the recent forms.
    It is worthy of note, however, that in Lindman’s Brazilian type
    <i>Regnellidium diphyllum</i> (<a href="#fig326">fig. 326</a>, A), the leaflets are characterised
    by dichotomous and not by anastomosing veins.</p>

  <p>Hollick<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> has described some impressions of imperfect orbicular
    leaves with a “finely flabellate obscurely reticulated(?) venation”
    from Cretaceous rocks of Long Island as <i>Marsilia Andersoni</i>,
    but these are too fragmentary to be accorded this generic
    designation. My friend Dr Krasser informs me that he is
    describing some well-preserved leaves from Cretaceous beds of
    Grünbach in Lower Austria as <i>Marsilia Nathorsti</i><a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>. He compares
    these with the recent form <i>Marsilia elata</i>, a variety of
    <i>M. Drummondi</i>.</p>

  <p>Another Lower Cretaceous species <i>Marsilia perucensis</i> has
    been figured by Frič and Bayer<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> as a stalked fruit-like body
    from Bohemia. This was originally described by Velenovský as
    <i>M. cretacea</i>, but under this name Heer<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> had previously recorded
    a supposed sporocarp from Greenland. These fossils have little
    claim to recognition as examples of Marsiliaceous plants.</p>

  <p>The fragment figured by Heer<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> from Tertiary rocks of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>Oeningen as <i>Pilularia pedunculata</i> is too small to determine
    with reasonable accuracy. Other supposed representatives of
    the family mentioned in palaeobotanical literature are not of
    sufficient importance to describe.</p>

  <h4 id="Salviniaceae">Salviniaceae.</h4>

  <p>The two genera of Salviniaceae, <i>Salvinia</i> and <i>Azolla</i>, are
    water plants, and are usually described as annuals which survive
    the less favourable season in the form of detached sporocarps.
    Goebel<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> states that all the tropical species of <i>Salvinia</i> known to
    him have an unlimited existence.</p>

  <p><i>Salvinia natans</i>, Hoffm., the only European species, extends
    from the South of France to Northern China and the plains of
    India: the other twelve species are mostly tropical. <i>Azolla</i>,
    represented by four species, occurs in Western and Southern
    North America, South America, Madagascar, Australia, New
    Zealand, and is widely spread in tropical Asia and Africa.</p>

  <p>Species of <i>Azolla</i> frequently form a considerable proportion
    of the floating carpet of vegetation on inland waters<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> growing
    under conditions which might be supposed favourable for preservation
    in a fossil state.</p>

  <p>The Salviniaceae, though probably rather farther removed
    than the Marsiliaceae from the homosporous Filicineae, are considered
    by Bower<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> to be related to the Gradatae, but modified
    in consequence of their aquatic habit and the assumption of
    heterospory.</p>

  <p>No undoubted examples of fossil species of <i>Azolla</i> have
    been described. <i>Salvinia</i>, on the other hand, is represented by
    several Tertiary species, for the most part founded on leaves
    only, and Hollick<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>, who published a list of fossil Salvinias, has
    described detached leaves as <i>Salvinia elliptica</i> Newb. from what
    may be Upper Cretaceous rocks from Carbonado, Washington.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>Some of the leaves figured as Tertiary Salvinias are of no value
    as evidence of the former distribution of the genus<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>.</p>

  <p>From the Coal-beds of Yen-Bäi (Tonkin), probably of Miocene
    age, Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> has figured some well-preserved impressions of
    oval or orbicular leaves, 15 mm. long and 10–20 mm. broad,
    characterised by reticulate venation and by cordate bases,
    which he refers to Heer’s Swiss species <i>Salvinia formosa</i><a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>.</p>

  <p>Dr Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> in the most recently published part of his series
    of valuable résumés of palaeobotanical literature refers to a
    description by Brabenec of specimens of this species from
    Bohemian Tertiary beds showing both microspores and megaspores.</p>

  <p>One of the most complete specimens so far discovered has
    recently been described by Fritel<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> from Eocene beds of the Paris
    Basin as <i>Salvinia Zeilleri</i>. This species, founded on portions of
    stems bearing floating leaves, submerged root-like leaves, and
    sporocarps, is compared with a recent tropical American species
    <i>S. auriculata</i>.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that no authentic records of Hydropterideae
    have been discovered in Palaeozoic rocks<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>. Comparisons have
    been made in the case of the genera <i>Traquairia</i> Carr. and
    <i>Sporocarpon</i> Will. with the reproductive organs of <i>Azolla</i><a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>,
    but these rest on a wholly insufficient basis.</p>

  <p>Dawson<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> proposed the generic name <i>Protosalvinia</i> for some
    spores of Devonian age, which he regarded on inadequate
    grounds as evidence of Palaeozoic Hydropterideae.</p>

  <p>Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>, in discussing the possible relationships of the
    problematical type <i>Chorionopteris gleichenioides</i> Cord., suggests
    a possible alliance with the Hydropterideae. Corda founded
    the genus <i>Chorionopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> on some small fragments of pinnules,
    6–7 mm. long, found in the Carboniferous rocks of Radnitz in
    Bohemia.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span></p>

  <p>The lobes of the pinnules are incurved distally to form a
    capsule, containing four sporangia, which apparently opened on
    dehiscence into four valves; the spores are of one size. The
    material is however insufficient for accurate determination.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence contributed by fossil records which
    indicates a high antiquity for the Hydropterideae. It is unsafe
    to base any conclusion on the absence of undoubted Palaeozoic
    representatives of this group; but the almost complete absence
    of records in pre-Tertiary strata is a fact which may be allowed
    some weight in regard to the possible evolution of the heterosporous
    filicales at a comparatively late period in the earth’s
    history.</p>

  <p>A description of the Mesozoic genus <i>Sagenopteris</i> may be
    conveniently included in this chapter, though as in many other
    instances the inclusion of a genus under the heading of a recent
    family name does not by any means imply that the position of
    the extinct type is regarded as settled.</p>

  <h4 id="Sagenopteris">Sagenopteris.</h4>

  <p>This generic name was applied by Presl<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> to small fronds
    composed of four or rarely two palmately disposed leaflets with
    a more or less distinct midrib and anastomosing secondary
    veins. Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> compared <i>Sagenopteris</i> with <i>Marsilia</i>, but
    did not regard the resemblance as evidence of relationship.
    Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> expressed the opinion that certain fruit-like bodies
    obtained from the Rhaetic beds of Scania are of the nature of
    sporocarps and were borne by <i>Sagenopteris</i>, with the leaves of
    which they were associated. He published a drawing of part of
    a fruit showing on its partially flattened surface some raised
    oval bodies which are considered to be spores. Dr Nathorst
    kindly placed at my disposal the drawings reproduced in
    <a href="#fig325">fig. 325</a> made from some of his specimens found at Bjuf in
    Scania.</p>

  <p>In contour and superficial features, e.g. the veining on
    the wall, these bodies bear a fairly close resemblance to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>sporocarps of recent species of <i>Marsilia</i>. They were found in
    association with the leaves of <i>Sagenopteris undulata</i> Nath.,
    an abundant Scania type similar in form to the English Jurassic
    species <i>S. Phillipsi</i> (figs. <a href="#fig327">327</a>, <a href="#fig328">328</a>). Heer was independently
    led by an examination of some examples of the Swedish “fruits”
    to compare them with the sporocarps of <i>Marsilia</i>. A small
    spherical body is figured by Zigno<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> close to a leaf of his
    species <i>S. angustifolia</i>, which may be a sporocarp. In a recent
    paper, Salfeld<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> says that he found fructification on the lower
    face of the leaflets of <i>S. Nilssoniana</i> Brongn. from German
    Jurassic rocks, but he brings forward no evidence in support of
    this statement. The systematic position of <i>Sagenopteris</i> is by
    no means settled. In a previous account of the genus I
    expressed the view that it is probably a member of the true
    ferns<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>, but the resemblance of Dr Nathorst’s drawings to the
    Marsilian sporocarps influences me in favour of his opinion that
    <i>Sagenopteris</i> may belong to the Hydropterideae. The evidence,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>as Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> states, is not wholly satisfactory: Schenk
    points out that the frequent occurrence of detached <i>Sagenopteris</i>
    leaflets suggests that they easily fell off the petiole, whereas in
    <i>Marsilia</i> the leaflets do not fall off independently. The discovery
    of a new type of Marsiliaceae in Brazil, which Lindman
    has described as <i>Regnellidium diphyllum</i><a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> (<a href="#fig326">fig. 326</a>, A), affords
    an additional piece of evidence bearing on the comparison
    of <i>Sagenopteris</i> with members of this family. In <i>Regnellidium</i>
    the leaves differ from those of <i>Marsilia</i> in bearing two instead
    of four leaflets, and in the former the veins are repeatedly forked,
    and do not anastomose as in <i>Marsilia</i>. In the possession
    of only two leaflets <i>Regnellidium</i> agrees with some forms of
    <i>Sagenopteris</i> (<a href="#fig328">fig. 328</a>).</p>

  <p>The fronds of this common Jurassic species, which is
    recorded from many European localities, from North America,
    Australia, the Antarctic regions<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>, and elsewhere, are very variable

  </blockquote>

  <p>It is probable that Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> was correct in his opinion that
    the specimen figured by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> as <i>Otopteris
    cuneata</i>, characterised by two leaflets (<a href="#fig328">fig. 328</a>), is not specifically
    distinct from the normal form with four leaflets (<a href="#fig327">fig. 327</a>).</p>

  <p>Similarly, such specimens as that represented in Pl. <span class="allsmcap">XVIII.</span>,
    fig. 3 of the first part of my <i>Jurassic Flora</i>, in which a short

    two leaflets from Jurassic rocks of Korea as <i>Sagenopteris

    a specimen similar to that represented in <a href="#fig328">fig. 328</a> from

  <p>The leaf shown in <a href="#fig327">fig. 327</a>, A, in which the longest segments
    are 4·5 cm. in length, represents the most abundant form and
    illustrates the very close agreement between <i>S. Phillipsi</i> and
    the Rhaetic species <i>S. rhoifolia</i>. Fig. 327, B, which is drawn
    from a specimen figured by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>, shows a leaf
    with longer (6·5 cm.) and much narrower segments. Broader
    leaflets are occasionally met with in which the lamina reaches
    a length of 11 cm.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

  <p>Leaves with leaflets narrower (3 mm. broad) than those

  <p><i>Sagenopteris</i> is recorded also from several Rhaetic floras.
    The best known species, <i>S. rhoifolia</i> Presl<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>, is hardly distinguishable
    from some forms of <i>S. Phillipsi</i> or from the Italian
    Jurassic species described by Zigno as <i>S. Goeppertiana</i><a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>, though
    the leaflets are usually rather larger. This species was first
    described by Brongniart as <i>Filicites Nilssoniana</i><a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>, and a few
    authors<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> have adopted this specific name because of its priority
    over Presl’s designation. As Nathorst remarks, to give up
    the well-known name <i>S. rhoifolia</i> for <i>S. Nilssoniana</i> is “mere
    pedantry.” The epidermis of <i>S. rhoifolia</i> as figured by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>
    consists of cells with straight and not undulating walls:
    stomata occur on the lower surface (<a href="#fig326">fig. 326</a>, B).</p>

  <p>Rhaetic leaves of the type represented by <i>S. rhoifolia</i> have
    a wide geographical distribution.</p>

  <p>The specimens described by Feistmantel from the Damuda
    series of India as <i>Sagenopteris longifolia</i> are no doubt fronds
    of <i>Glossopteris longifolia</i><a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>.</p>

  <p>The Wealden species <i>Sagenopteris Mantelli</i> (Dunk.)<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> agrees
    closely in habit and in the form of the leaflets with <i>S. Phillipsi</i>
    and <i>S. rhoifolia</i>. It is probable that some of the leaves
    described by Velenovský<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> from Lower Cretaceous rocks in
    Bohemia as <i>Thinnfeldia variabilis</i> are portions of <i>Sagenopteris</i>
    fronds. <i>S. Mantelli</i> is recorded from several European localities,
    from California<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span></p>

  <p><i>Sagenopteris</i> appears to have been widely distributed during
    the Rhaetic, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous floras. The very
    great similarity between the specimens recorded from these three
    formations renders the genus an uncertain guide in regard to
    geological age. Decisive evidence as to its position in the
    plant kingdom is at present lacking: the inclusion of the genus
    as a possible member of the Hydropterideae has still to be
    justified.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">GENERA OF PTERIDOSPERMS, FERNS, AND <i>PLANTAE
    INCERTAE SEDIS.</i></div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> genera and species described in this Chapter are
    founded on sterile leaves or portions of leaves, and in the great
    majority of cases the reproductive organs are either imperfectly
    known or have still to be discovered. Some of the genera, the
    smaller number, are no doubt true ferns, while most of them
    may safely be regarded as plants which will ultimately be shown
    to belong to some other group, in most cases that of the
    Pteridosperms. It is possible that a few of the types may be
    members of the Cycadophyta rather than of the Pteridospermeae,
    but evidence as to systematic position is for the most part of a
    negative kind or too incomplete to lead to any definite expression
    of opinion as to the cycadean or pteridosperm nature of the imperfectly
    known Palaeozoic or Mesozoic species. Many of the
    genera are of little botanical interest, though even the most problematical
    are of importance as criteria of geological age. Genera
    which there is good reason for including in the Pteridosperms
    are dealt with in this section, in order that the Chapter in
    Volume <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> devoted to this important group may be limited
    to more completely known types.</p>

  <p>In most text-books it is customary to employ family names
    for sterile fern-like fronds which possess similar venation
    features or have in common certain vegetative characters, the
    value of which it is impossible to estimate. In the following
    account family or group names are not adopted, on the ground
    that such slight utility as they may have is more than counterbalanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
    by the risk attending a grouping under one name of
    plants which may agree only in unessential characters. The
    practice of classifying fossil plants has been carried to excess.
    Grouping together genera as a matter of convenience unavoidably
    creates a prejudice in favour of actual relationship, which may
    or may not exist.</p>

  <h4 id="Taeniopteris">Taeniopteris.</h4>

  <p>This generic name was instituted by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> for simple
    linear or broadly linear leaves with a prominent midrib from
    which secondary veins, simple or dichotomously branched, are
    given off at right angles or obliquely. The frond of the type-species
    <i>Taeniopteris vittata</i> (<a href="#fig332">fig. 332</a>), characteristic of Jurassic
    floras, was compared by Brongniart with the pinnules of <i>Danaea</i>
    and <i>Angiopteris</i>. Among recent ferns the Taeniopteris form
    of frond and venation is represented by <i>Oleandra neriiformis</i>,
    <i>Asplenium nidus</i>, and many other species. Though usually
    applied to fronds which there is good reason for regarding as
    simple leaves, the generic designation <i>Taeniopteris</i> has been
    extended to include pinnate fronds, e.g. the Upper Palaeozoic
    species <i>T. jejunata</i> Grand’Eury, and <i>T. Carnoti</i> Ren. and Zeill.
    (<a href="#fig330">fig. 330</a>, A). The compound fronds from the Lower Coal-Measures
    of Missouri described by Dr White<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> as <i>T. missouriensis</i>
    are characterised by decurrent and confluent Taeniopteroid
    pinnules. In a later reference<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> to this plant White pertinently
    adds, “perhaps it belongs more properly in <i>Alethopteris</i>.”</p>

  <p>Leaves of the <i>Taeniopteris</i> type are described by several
    authors as species of <i>Oleandridium</i>, <i>Angiopteridium</i>, <i>Danaeites</i>,
    <i>Marattia</i>, and other genera. In such species of Taeniopteroid
    leaves as have been dealt with in a former Chapter, the
    occurrence of sori justifies the substitution of a name denoting
    a close relationship to existing members of the Marattiaceae,
    but in the absence of fertile specimens the provisional designation
    <i>Taeniopteris</i> should be retained. It is often difficult to
    decide between <i>Taeniopteris</i> and <i>Nilssonia</i> as the more suitable
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>name to apply to fragments of fossil leaves of Mesozoic age.
    <i>Taeniopteris</i> is, however, distinguished from the Cycadean genus
    by the greater prominence of the rachis, also by the dichotomous
    branching of the secondary veins, usually close to their origin
    and at varying distances between the axis of the frond and the
    edge of the lamina. The genus <i>Taeniopteris</i>, though most
    abundant in Rhaetic and Jurassic strata, occurs also in Upper
    Carboniferous and Lower Permian rocks. The generic name
    <i>Macrotaeniopteris</i> instituted by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> has been used for
    leaves differing only in size from the usual type of <i>Taeniopteris</i>,
    but there is no adequate reason for its retention.</p>

  <p>The species included in <i>Taeniopteris</i> afford no satisfactory
    evidence as to their systematic position. It is obviously unwise
    to adopt such generic titles as <i>Oleandridium</i>, <i>Marattiopsis</i>, etc.,
    merely because of resemblance in the venation of sterile
    fragments to <i>Oleandra</i> or Marattiaceous ferns.</p>

  <p>Some specimens of <i>Taeniopteris</i> fronds described by
    Mr Sellards<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> from Permian rocks of Kansas, which are referred
    to later, have furnished unconvincing evidence of reproductive
    organs.</p>

  <h6><i>Taeniopteris multinervis</i>, Weiss. Fig. 329, A, B.</h6>

  <p>The late Dr Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> instituted this species (which he designated
    <i>Taeniopteris multinervia</i>, though the specific name <i>multinervis</i>
    is constantly used) for a fragment of a leaf from the Lower
    Permian of Lebach characterised by numerous forked veins
    given off at right angles from a prominent rachis (<a href="#fig329">fig. 329</a>, B).
    This type of frond is recorded from the Permian of Trienbach
    (Alsace) by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>, by Renault<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> from the Upper
    Carboniferous of Autun, and from other localities. The lamina
    of the simple leaf reaches a breadth of 6 cm. and a length
    of 40 cm. (<a href="#fig329">fig. 329</a>, A); the numerous secondary veins (25–36
    per cm. of lamina) are either at right angles to the rachis
    or given off at an acute angle. The mesophyll consists of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>polygonal cells some of which are elongated at right angles to
    the surface of the lamina. A very similar form is described
    by Fontaine and White from the Permian of Virginia as <i>T.
      Lescuriana</i><a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is futile to expect to be able to separate the numerous
    <i>Taeniopteris</i> leaves into well-defined species: all we can do is
    to group the specimens under different names, using as artificial
    distinctions such characters as the shape of the leaf, the
    number of veins per centimetre, and the prominence of the rachis.
    Another Virginian species of Permian age described by Fontaine
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>and White<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>, <i>T. Newberriana</i>, is said to bear sori, but no
    satisfactory information is given as to the nature of these
    organs. Specimens referred with some hesitation to this
    species and to a similar species, <i>T. coriacea</i>, have been described
    by Sellards<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> from material obtained from Permian beds in
    Kansas. The lamina of the simple linear fronds is characterised
    by the occurrence of small oval bodies half immersed in the
    substance of the leaf between the secondary veins (<a href="#fig330">figs. 330</a>, D, E).
    One of these bodies is represented in an apparently dehisced
    condition in <a href="#fig330">fig. 330</a>, D. Sellards suggests the possibility that
    these bodies are sporangia, but, as he points out, they afford no
    indication of cellular structure nor are they in direct connexion
    with the veins.</p>

  <h6><i>Taeniopteris jejunata</i>, Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>.</h6>

  <p>This species differs from <i>T. multinervis</i> in its bipinnate fronds;
    the linear or oval-linear pinnae are attached by a short stalk to
    the primary rachis and reach a length of 25 cm.; the veins are
    less crowded, 12–15 per centimetre.</p>

  <p><i>T. jejunata</i> is recorded from the Coal-fields of the Loire and
    Commentry<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> in France, from the Lower Permian of Thuringia<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>,
    and elsewhere.</p>

  <h6><i>Taeniopteris Carnoti</i>, Ren. and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a>. Fig. 330, A.</h6>

  <p>This species, founded on portions of pinnate fronds from the
    Coal-field of Commentry, is characterised by rather broader
    (25–30 mm.) pinnules, with short pedicels and a cordate base,
    reaching a length of 25–30 cm. The secondary forked veins are
    more numerous than in <i>T. jejunata</i>. In <i>T. multinervis</i> the
    pinnules are still broader and have a stronger midrib.</p>

  <p>Several species of <i>Taeniopteris</i> have been described from
    Triasso-Rhaetic rocks in Europe, India, Tonkin and elsewhere.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>In some cases it is practically impossible to recognise clear
    specific distinctions between Rhaetic and Jurassic types.</p>

  <p>From the Damuda and Panchet series of India (Triasso-Rhaetic)
    Feistmantel has described large sterile fronds as
    <i>Macrotaeniopteris Feddeni</i><a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> which reach a breadth of 20 cm.:
    these may be compared with the Indian species <i>Taeniopteris lata</i>
    Oldham<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>, and to <i>T. gigantea</i> from the Rhaetic of Franconia<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>
    and Scania. A specimen of this species figured by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>
    from Scania has a lamina 33 cm. broad. Other examples are
    afforded by <i>M. Wianamattae</i> Feist.<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> from rocks of the same age
    in Australia and by <i>Taeniopteris superba</i> Sap.<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> from Lower
    Rhaetic rocks near Autun.</p>

  <p>From the Rhaetic of Tonkin, Zeiller records several species,
    among which may be mentioned <i>T. Jourdyi</i> Zeill.<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> and
    <i>T. spatulata</i> MacClelland (<a href="#fig330">fig. 330</a>, B, C). Both have simple
    fronds. Those of <i>T. Jourdyi</i> reach a length of 10–40 cm.
    and a breadth of 10–70 mm.; the rachis is characterised by
    crowded and discontinuous transverse folds, and the secondary
    veins (35–50 per cm.) are usually at right angles to the rachis.
    This Tonkin species is compared by Zeiller with the European
    Rhaetic species <i>T. tenuinervis</i> Brauns.</p>

  <p>The polymorphism of the fronds is a striking feature: in one
    case described by Zeiller the lamina appears to be divided into
    segments like those characteristic of the leaf of the Cycadean
    genus <i>Anomozamites</i>. It is obviously difficult in many instances
    to distinguish between detached Taeniopteroid pinnae
    of a compound frond and complete simple leaves. In some
    compound fern fronds, as in the recent Polypodiaceous genus
    <i>Didymochlaena</i>, the pinnules are deciduous, and the same feature
    undoubtedly characterised the fronds of many extinct species.
    A specimen figured by Zeiller which shows several petioles of
    <i>T. Jourdyi</i> attached to a thick stem<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> demonstrates the simple
    nature of the leaves. In other cases, e.g. <i>T. vittata</i>, specimens
    occur in which the slightly enlarged petiole-base has a clean-cut
    surface indicating abscission from a rhizome (<a href="#fig332">fig. 332</a>).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span></p>

  <p>The fronds described by Zeiller as <i>T. spatulata</i><a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> (<a href="#fig330">fig. 330</a>, B, C)
    closely resemble Jurassic leaves from Victoria referred to
    <i>Taeniopteris Daintreei</i> McCoy<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>.</p>

  <p>The simple fronds included under this specific name are
    characterised by a strong midrib from which numerous simple
    or forked secondary veins are given off at a right angle or
    slightly inclined. The breadth of the lamina decreases
    gradually towards the petiole. The Australian species named
    by McCoy <i>Taeniopteris Daintreei</i>, to which Carruthers referred
    the Queensland fossils, has a much narrower and more linear
    form of frond, and for this reason Tenison-Woods instituted a
    new specific name. <i>T. Carruthersi</i> represents a form of leaf met
    with in Rhaetic, or possibly Upper Triassic, rocks in S. Africa<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>
    and Australia. A very similar, perhaps an identical type, was
    described from Argentina by Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> as <i>T. mareyiaca</i>: among
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>many other examples of this form of frond may be mentioned
    <i>T. immersa</i><a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> Nath. from the Rhaetic rocks of Scania and <i>T.
    virgulata</i> from the Rhaetic of Tonkin<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>.</p>

  <p>A comparison of <i>Taeniopteris Carruthersi</i> or various other
    “species” of Rhaetic fronds with the Jurassic species <i>T. vittata</i>
    illustrates the slight and unimportant differences on which
    specific separation is based. It is hopeless to attempt to draw
    a satisfactory distinction between the numerous Taeniopteris
    fronds from Upper Triassic and Jurassic rocks.</p>

  <h6><i>Taeniopteris vittata</i>, Brongniart. Fig. 332.</h6>

  <p>The simple leaves to which Brongniart applied this name
    are characteristic of the Inferior Oolite flora of England, and
    examples of the same type are recorded from Jurassic rocks of
    India, Poland, the Arctic regions, Japan, China, Australia and
    other countries<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Leaf linear-lanceolate, reaching a length of more than 20 cm. and a
      breadth of 3 cm. The lamina increases gradually in breadth from the
      base and tapers towards the apex. Numerous secondary veins are given
      off at right angles from a broad midrib: the lateral veins may be simple
      or forked close to their origin, near the margin, or in the intermediate
      portion, of the lamina.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is exceedingly difficult to use <i>Taeniopteris</i> leaves of this
    form as evidence in regard to the Jurassic or Rhaetic age of
    plant-bearing strata. The species <i>T. tenuinervis</i> Brauns, as
    figured by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> from the Rhaetic rocks of Germany and
    Persia, and recorded from several other regions, presents a
    close agreement with <i>T. vittata</i>. <i>Oleandridium lentriculiforme</i>
    Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> from the Hawkesbury series of Australia is
    another similar leaf. The species <i>T. vittata</i> from the Yorkshire
    coast, represented in <a href="#fig332">fig. 332</a>, shows a well-preserved petiole
    with a clean-cut base like that of the petioles of <i>Oleandra
      neriiformis</i> and other recent ferns which are detached from the
    rhizome by the action of an absciss-layer.</p>

  <p>A broader form of frond with similar venation was described
    by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> as <i>Taeniopteris major</i>. An examination
    of the type-specimen from the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire, now
    in the Manchester Museum, led me to doubt the necessity of
    specific separation from <i>T. vittata</i><a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>.</p>

  <p>A smaller frond of the same general type as <i>T. vittata</i> is
    recorded from Wealden strata of North Germany and England
    under the name <i>T. Beyrichii</i><a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Weichselia">Weichselia.</h4>

  <p>This generic name was instituted by Stiehler<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> for impressions
    of bipinnate sterile fronds, presumably ferns, from
    Lower Cretaceous rocks near Quedlinburg. The same type of
    leaf from English Wealden beds had previously been referred
    by Mantell and other authors to <i>Pecopteris</i>, and by Brongniart
    to his genus <i>Lonchopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>. It is, however, advisable to follow
    Nathorst’s example<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> and restrict the latter name to Palaeozoic
    species. As already suggested, it would obviate confusion to
    substitute a new generic designation for <i>Lonchopteris</i> in the
    case of Triassic species which are probably members of the
    Osmundaceae. The type-species of Stiehler, <i>Weichselia Ludowicae</i><a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>,
    does not differ in any important character from
    <i>Weichselia Mantelli</i>, the species originally described by Stokes
    and Webb from the Wealden of England as <i>Pecopteris reticulata</i>.</p>

    has been adduced.</p>

  <p>The broad and strong rachis is comparable with that of

    Fontaine in his adherence to strict priority.</p>

  <h4 id="Glossopteris">Glossopteris.</h4>

  <p>The name <i>Glossopteris</i> was proposed by Brongniart in 1822<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>
    for an imperfect leaf-impression which he called <i>Filicites</i>
    (<i>Glossopteris</i>) <i>dubius</i>, but the specimen so named has since
    been identified as part of a sporophyll of a <i>Lepidostrobus</i>. The
    author of the genus afterwards published<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> a diagnosis, based
    on well-preserved leaves from Permo-Carboniferous rocks in
    Australia and India, of the type-species <i>Glossopteris Browniana</i>,
    the Indian examples being distinguished as <i>G. Browniana</i> var.
    <i>indica</i> while the Australian form was named <i>G. Browniana</i>
    var. <i>australasica</i>. Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> afterwards raised the Indian
    fossils to specific rank as <i>G. indica</i> though some authors<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> have
    continued to consider the two forms as insufficiently distinct to
    be regarded as different species.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Glossopteris</i> may be defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Leaves simple, varying considerably in size, shape, and venation
      characters, but almost without exception characterised by repeatedly
      anastomosing lateral veins. The leaves are of two kinds: (i) <i>foliage
      leaves</i>; apparently always sterile, usually spathulate, with an obtuse apex,
      a well-marked midrib which may persist to the apex or die out in the
      upper half of the lamina, characterised by its slight prominence and
      comparatively great breadth especially in the basal part of the frond. In
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>most cases the lamina extends as a narrow margin to the leaf-base, but in
      a few forms there is a short petiole (<a href="#fig334">fig. 334</a>). Though usually spathulate,
      the frond may be linear-lanceolate, or ovate; the apex is sometimes acute.
      Leaves vary in length from 3 to 40 cm. and may in larger forms have a
      breadth of 10 cm. Numerous lateral veins curve upwards and outwards
      to the margin of the lamina or pursue a straight course almost at right-angles
      to the midrib. (ii) <i>Scale-leaves</i><a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> which differ from the foliage-leaves
      in their much smaller size and in the absence of a midrib; they are deltoid,
      oval or cordate in shape and generally terminate in an acute apex; the
      edge of the lamina may be slightly incurved so that the leaf presents a
      convex upper surface supplied with anastomosing veins. The scale-leaves,
      which vary in length from about 1 to 6 cm., probably acted as sporophylls.
      The only evidence as to the nature of the fructification so far obtained
      is represented by empty sporangium-like organs (1·2–1·5 mm. long by
      0·6–0·8 mm. broad) frequently associated with the scale-leaves<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>.</p>

    <p>The leaves, in some cases at least, were borne near together on a
      cylindrical stem or rhizome which produced branched adventitious roots<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>.
      The fossils long known as <i>Vertebraria</i> were recognised by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> and by
      Oldham<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> as the stems of <i>Glossopteris</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The systematic position of <i>Glossopteris</i> must for the present
    be left an open question. Though usually spoken of as a fern,
    it is noteworthy that despite the enormous abundance of its
    foliage leaves in the Permo-Carboniferous strata of India,
    Australia, South Africa, and South America, no single example
    has been discovered which shows undoubted remains of sori
    or sporangia. Many authors have described fertile leaves of
    <i>Glossopteris</i>; but it was not until Arber’s discovery of sporangia
    in close association with the scale-leaves that any light was
    thrown on the nature of the reproductive organs.</p>

  <p>The probability is that <i>Glossopteris</i> was not a true fern but
    a member of that large and ever-increasing class, the Pteridosperms.
    This opinion is based largely on negative evidence.
    Such sporangia as have been described may have contained
    microspores and the plant may have been heterosporous. The
    occurrence of seeds in association with Glossopteris fronds
    recorded by more than one writer<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>, though by no means
    decisive and possibly the result of chance association, is favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
    to this view. Dr White<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> has suggested that the small
    leaves described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> as <i>Ottokaria bengalensis</i> from Lower
    Gondwana (Permo-Carboniferous) rocks of India, and similar
    fossils recorded by himself from Brazil as <i>O. ovalis</i>, may represent
    “sporangiferous” organs of <i>Glossopteris</i> or <i>Gangamopteris</i>,
    “both of which are probably pteridospermic.” There is, however,
    no conclusive evidence in support of this suggestion.</p>

  <p>The genus, whatever its position may be, has a special interest
    for the geologist and for the student of plant distribution; it is
    a characteristic member of a Permo-Carboniferous flora which
    flourished over an enormous area, including India, South Africa,—extending
    from Cape Colony to Rhodesia and German East
    Africa<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>,—Australia, and South America<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>. This flora, known as
    the Glossopteris flora, differed considerably in its component
    genera from that which overspread Europe and North America
    and some more southern regions in the Upper Carboniferous
    and Permian periods.</p>

  <p>The discovery by Amalitzky<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> of <i>Glossopteris</i>, and other genera
    characteristic of the Glossopteris flora, in the Upper Permian
    rocks in Vologda (Russia) demonstrates the existence of a
    northern outpost of the southern botanical province, and
    Zeiller’s discovery of the genus in the Rhaetic flora of Tonkin<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>
    shows that <i>Glossopteris</i> persisted beyond the limits of the
    Palaeozoic epoch. Dr David White<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> has recently proposed to
    re-christen the Glossopteris flora the Gangamopteris flora on the
    ground that <i>Gangamopteris</i> is strictly Palaeozoic in its range,
    whereas <i>Glossopteris</i> persisted into the Mesozoic era; this is
    perhaps hardly a sufficient reason for giving up so well
    established a title as the Glossopteris flora. A fuller account
    of this southern flora must be reserved for another volume.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>
  <h6><i>Glossopteris Browniana</i>, Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a>. <a href="#fig334">Figs. 334–36</a>.</h6>

  <p>The specific name <i>Browniana</i> is now applied to obtusely
    pointed leaves which sometimes reach a length of 15 cm., but
    are usually rather shorter. In form and venation they closely
    resemble the leaves of the recent genus <i>Antrophyum</i> and
    species of <i>Acrostichum</i>. The comparatively broad midrib may
    be replaced in its proximal portion by several parallel veins:
    from it are given off numerous lateral veins which form a
    reticulum characterised by meshes approximately equal in size

  <p>The drawings, originally published by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>, reproduced
    in <a href="#fig335">fig. 335</a> illustrate the venation and its range of variation;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>the meshes are usually hexagonal and arranged as shown in
    figs. A and B, but occasionally (<a href="#fig335">fig. 335</a>, C) they follow a more
    steeply inclined course.</p>

  <p>Small leaves with a more or less distinct midrib, 2–3 cm.
    in length, supply transitional stages between foliage- and scale-leaves.
    In the true scale-leaves spreading and occasionally
    anastomosing veins take the place of the midrib and lateral
    veins of the ordinary frond. McCoy<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> in describing some
    Australian specimens of <i>Glossopteris</i> in 1847 spoke of scale-like
    appendages of the rhizome which he compared with the large
    ramenta of <i>Acrostichum</i> and other ferns. It was, however, Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a>
    who first recognised the leaf-nature of these scales and adequately
    described them; additional figures of scale-leaves have
    been published by Mr Arber<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> and by myself<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>. The importance
    of these small leaves has been considerably increased by
    Mr Arber’s discovery of associated sporangia which, as he
    suggests, were probably borne on their lower concave surface.</p>

  <p>The sporangia (<a href="#fig336">fig. 336</a>) are compared by Arber with the

    sporangia described by Zeiller as <i>Discopteris Rallii</i> (<a href="#fig256">fig. 256</a>, D);
    the latter are distinguished by the well-defined group of thicker
    walled cells representing the annulus of true fern sporangia.
    We know nothing as to the contents of the Glossopteris
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>sporangia, whether they contained microspores or whether they

  <p>The rhizome of <i>Glossopteris Browniana</i> has been described
    in detail by Zeiller, who first demonstrated that the fossils
    originally assigned by Royle<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> to the genus <i>Vertebraria</i> represent
    the stem of this and, as we now know, of some other species of
    <i>Glossopteris</i>. <i>Vertebraria</i> occurs in abundance in Permo-Carboniferous
    strata in association with <i>Glossopteris</i>; the differences
    between Australian, Indian, and South forms, though expressed
    by specific names, are insignificant. The stems are usually preserved
    in the form of flattened, single or branched, axes sometimes
    bearing slender branched roots and characterised by one or two,
    or less frequently three, longitudinal grooves or ridges (<a href="#fig337">fig. 337</a>)
    from which lateral grooves or ridges are given off at right angles,
    dividing the surface into more or less rectangular areas 1 cm. or
    more in length. The surface of these areas is often slightly
    convex and in some specimens the outlines of cells may be
    detected. Mr Oldham has described some interesting examples
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>of <i>Vertebraria</i> from India in which the longitudinal and transverse
    grooves are occupied by a dark brown ferruginous substance
    or by the carbonised remains of plant-tissues (<a href="#fig338">fig. 338</a>, C, D).
    In transverse section, a <i>Vertebraria</i> cast appears to be divided
    into a number of wedge-shaped segments radiating from a
    common centre. Prof. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> has figured specimens of <i>Vertebraria</i>
    with portions of Glossopteris fronds still attached.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The rhizome of <i>Glossopteris</i>, as represented by the Vertebraria
    casts, is aptly compared by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> with that of the recent
    Polypodiaceous fern <i>Onoclea struthiopteris</i>. Sections of the
    recent stem (<a href="#fig338">fig. 338</a>, E, F) show that the form is irregularly
    stellate owing to the presence of prominent wings which
    anastomose laterally at intervals as shown by the examination
    of a series of sections. The leaf-traces are derived from the
    steles of adjacent wings. Fig. 338 (B and A) represents somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
    diagrammatically a longitudinal and transverse view of a
    <i>Vertebraria</i>; the radiating arms represented in the transverse
    section (fig. A) are the stem ribs or wings and the segments
    between them are intrusions of sedimentary material. The
    rectangular areas characteristic of the surface of a <i>Vertebraria</i>
    are the intruded segments of rock: these are separated at
    intervals by transverse grooves, which mark the course of
    vascular strands given off at each anastomosis of the longitudinal
    wings to supply the leaves.</p>

  <p>Mr Oldham, who discovered the connexion between <i>Glossopteris</i>
    and <i>Vertebraria</i> independently of Dr Zeiller, does not
    agree with the interpretation of the structural features of the
    rhizome which Zeiller bases on a comparison between Vertebraria
    and <i>Onoclea struthiopteris</i>. Oldham<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> describes <i>Vertebraria</i> as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>consisting of a central axis “joined to an outer rind by a series
    of radial septa,” the spaces between the septa being divided
    into chambers by transverse partitions. His view is that the
    rhizome of <i>Glossopteris</i> was a cylindrical organ and not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
    irregularly winged axis like the stem of <i>Onoclea</i>. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> has
    replied in detail to Oldham’s interpretation and adheres to his
    original view, that the rhizome consisted of a solid axis with
    radial wings or flanges which at intervals anastomosed transversely
    in pairs at the nodes. It may, however, be possible that
    the spaces between the longitudinal and transverse grooves on
    a Vertebraria axis, which have been filled with the surrounding
    rock, were originally occupied in part at least by secondary wood,
    and the transverse strips of carbonaceous material<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> lying in the
    grooves may represent medullary-ray tissue and accompanying
    leaf-traces. The longitudinal striations seen in some specimens
    of <i>Vertebraria</i> on the areas between the grooves may be the
    impressions of woody tissue. It is impossible without the aid
    of more perfectly preserved material to arrive at a satisfactory
    conception of the structural features of a complete Glossopteris
    rhizome.</p>

  <p>In the specimen of <i>Glossopteris Browniana</i> shown in
    <a href="#fig339">fig. 339</a> several leaves are attached to an axis which shows
    none of the surface-features of <i>Vertebraria</i>. I am indebted
    to the kindness of Dr Mohlengraaff of Delft for the loan of this
    specimen which was obtained from Permo-Carboniferous rocks
    in the Transvaal. An axis figured by Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> from an
    Australian locality bears a tuft of <i>Glossopteris</i> leaves, possibly
    <i>G. Browniana</i>; in place of the rectangular areas characteristic
    of <i>Vertebraria</i> it shows transversely elongated leaf-scars or, on
    the internal cast, imbricate rod-like projections which Etheridge
    suggests represent vascular bundles.</p>

  <h6><i>Glossopteris indica</i>, Schimper. Figs. <a href="#fig340">340</a>, A, <a href="#fig341">341</a>.</h6>

  <p>It is a question of secondary importance whether or not
    the fronds which Brongniart spoke of as a variety of <i>Glossopteris
    Browniana</i> should be recognised as specifically distinct. The
    careful examination by Zeiller of the venation characters has,
    however, afforded justification for separating <i>G. Browniana</i> and
    <i>G. indica</i>. We must admit that the slight and not very constant
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>differences in the size and form of the meshes produced by the
    anastomosing of the lateral veins are characters which cannot
    be recognised as having more than a secondary value, though, as
    a matter of convenience, we employ them as aids to determination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
    The arbitrary separation of sterile leaves, which differ by
    small degrees from one another in form and in the details of
    venation, by the application of specific names is a thankless
    task necessitated by custom and convenience; it is, however, idle
    to ignore the artificial basis of such separation. Mr Arber has
    recently published, in his valuable <i>Glossopteris Flora</i>, an
    analytical key which serves to facilitate the description and
    determination of different types of frond<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>.</p>

  <p>The large leaves of <i>Glossopteris indica</i>, reaching a length in
    extreme cases of 40 cm. and a breadth of 10 cm., are characterised
    by a rather greater regularity in the arrangement of the
    meshes and by the greater parallelism of the upper and lower
    sides of each mesh (<a href="#fig341">fig. 341</a>) and by less difference in size
    between the venation meshes than in <i>G. Browniana</i>, the leaves
    of which are usually smaller. The relatively thick epidermis
    consists of rectangular cells with stomata in depressions<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>.
    The scale-leaves<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>, rather larger than those of <i>G. Browniana</i>,
    are more or less rhomboidal with rounded angles and reach
    a length of 1·5–6 cm. and a breadth of 1·5–2·5 cm. The
    rhizome is practically identical with that of <i>G. Browniana</i><a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>.</p>

  <h6><i>Glossopteris angustifolia</i>, Brongniart. Figs. <a href="#fig340">340</a>, B; <a href="#fig342">342</a>.</h6>

  <p>It is convenient to retain this designation for linear fronds
    with an acute or obtuse apex and a venation-reticulum
    composed of long and narrow meshes (<a href="#fig340">fig. 340</a>, B). It is by no
    means unlikely, as Arber suggests, that the same plant may
    have produced leaves of the <i>G. indica</i> type and narrower fronds
    which conform to <i>G. angustifolia</i>. In his description of some
    Indian specimens of <i>G. indica</i>, Zeiller draws attention to the
    variation exhibited in regard to the extent of anastomosing
    between the secondary veins: some examples with very few
    cross-connexions agree more closely with <i>Taeniopteris</i> than
    with <i>Glossopteris</i> as usually defined<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>. The venation shown in
    <a href="#fig342">fig. 342</a> illustrates an extreme case of what is almost certainly
    a Glossopteris leaf of the <i>G. angustifolia</i> type. This specimen,
    which was discovered by Mr Leslie in the Permo-Carboniferous
    sandstone of Vereeniging (Transvaal), has been referred to a
    variety of Brongniart’s species as <i>G. angustifolia</i> var. <i>taeniopteroides</i><a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a>
    on account of the almost complete absence of any cross-connexions.
    The reference to <i>Glossopteris</i>, which my friend
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>Dr Zeiller suggested, is amply justified by the form of the leaf
    as a whole, by the angle at which the lateral veins leave the
    midrib, a feature in contrast to the wider angle at which the
    lateral veins are usually given off in <i>Taeniopteris</i> (figs. <a href="#fig329">329</a>, <a href="#fig332">332</a>),
    and by the similarity to the Indian specimens already mentioned.
    Several authors have described leaves or leaflets under the generic
    name <i>Megalopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> from Carboniferous and Permian rocks
    which bear a close resemblance to the South African variety,
    but in some cases at least <i>Megalopteris</i> is known to be a pinnate
    and not a simple leaf. The leaf figured by Jack and Etheridge
    as <i>Taeniopteris</i> sp.<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> from Queensland may also be an example of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span><i>Glossopteris</i>. Comparison may be made also with the Palaeozoic
    leaves described in the first instance by Lesquereux and more
    recently by Renault and Zeiller as species of <i>Lesleya</i><a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> (<a href="#fig347">fig. 347</a>).</p>

  <h6><i>Blechnoxylon talbragarense</i>, Etheridge. Fig. 343.</h6>

  <p>Under this name Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> described some specimens
    from the Permo-Carboniferous Coal-Measures of New South
    Wales, which he regards as a fern, comparable, in the possession
    of a cylinder of secondary xylem, with the recent genus
    <i>Botrychium</i> and with <i>Lyginodendron</i> and other members of
    the Cycadofilices. The slender axis (1–3 mm. in diameter)
    appears to consist of a zone of radially disposed tissue
    (<a href="#fig343">fig. 343</a>, C, <i>x</i>), which is probably of the nature of secondary
    xylem, enclosing a pith and surrounded externally by imperfectly
    preserved remnants of cortex. Unfortunately no anatomical
    details could be made out, but the general appearance, if
    not due to inorganic structure, certainly supports Etheridge’s
    determination. The stem bore at intervals clusters of linear-lanceolate
    leaves (reaching 12 mm. in length) in close spirals
    (<a href="#fig343">fig. 343</a>, A and B); the leaves are characterised by a strong
    midrib and forked secondary veins. Small “pyriform” bodies of
    the nature of scale-leaves occur in association with the fronds
    (<a href="#fig343">fig. 343</a>, B, <i>s</i>).</p>

  <p>In his description of this interesting plant, Etheridge quotes
    an opinion which I expressed in regard to the comparison of the
    stem with those of <i>Botrychium</i>, <i>Lyginodendron</i>, and other
    genera. No satisfactory evidence has been found as to the
    nature of the fructification. Although the leaves of <i>Blechnoxylon</i>
    are much smaller than those of <i>Glossopteris</i>, I am now disposed
    to regard the genus as closely allied or even generically referable
    to <i>Glossopteris</i>. The crowded disposition of the leaves is like
    that in <i>Glossopteris</i>, shown in <a href="#fig339">fig. 339</a> and in the figures published
    by Etheridge and by Oldham; the association of scale-leaves
    and foliage-leaves is another feature in common. The absence
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>of a reticulum of anastomosing veins can no longer be considered
    a fatal objection to the suggestion that the Australian type
    may be a species of <i>Glossopteris</i>. If the view that <i>Blechnoxylon</i>
    is not a distinct genus is correct, the occurrence of secondary
    xylem is favourable to the opinion already expressed that
    <i>Glossopteris</i> is more likely to be a Pteridosperm than a true fern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
    The data at present available render it advisable to retain
    Mr Etheridge’s name: the comparison with <i>Glossopteris</i> lacks
    confirmation.</p>

  <p>In some <i>Glossopteris</i> leaves the anastomosing secondary

    to Indian fronds of this type; similar forms have been described
    as <i>G. conspicua</i> and <i>G. Tatei</i>. The type illustrated by <i>G. retifera</i>
    is recorded also from Permo-Carboniferous rocks in Zululand<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>,
    Natal, the Transvaal, Cape Colony, and the Argentine.</p>

  <h4 id="Gangamopteris">Gangamopteris.</h4>

  <p>In 1847 McCoy<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> described a leaf-fragment from Permo-Carboniferous
    rocks in New South Wales as <i>Cyclopteris
    angustifolia</i>. The type-specimen of this species, which is now
    in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, has been re-described
    by Mr Arber<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>. Subsequently<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> McCoy instituted the generic
    name <i>Gangamopteris</i> for leaves, like that previously referred
    by him to <i>Cyclopteris</i>, from the Bacchus Marsh Sandstone, of
    New South Wales, but he did not publish a diagnosis of the
    genus until several years later<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>. Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a>, who has
    described many species of <i>Gangamopteris</i> from the Lower
    Gondwana strata of India, slightly modified the original
    diagnosis. The genus is represented by sterile fronds only.
    We know nothing of the stem, and such evidence as is available
    in regard to the form of the fertile leaves is of a circumstantial
    kind. It is, however, highly probable that <i>Gangamopteris</i> is
    not a true fern but a Pteridosperm.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Leaves simple, sessile, varying in shape; obovate or spathulate, broadly
      lanceolate or rarely linear; the apex is usually blunt (<a href="#fig345">fig. 345</a>) but
      occasionally gradually tapered. In general appearance a Gangamopteris
      leaf is similar to that of <i>Glossopteris indica</i>, the chief distinction being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
      absence of a midrib. Gangamopteris leaves are on the whole larger than
      those of <i>Glossopteris</i>; many of them reach a length of 20 cm. and some of
      the large Indian fronds are nearly 40 cm. long. The venation of <i>Gangamopteris</i>
      shows a greater uniformity in the size and shape of the meshes
      than that of <i>Glossopteris</i>. The middle of the lamina, especially in the
      lower part, is occupied by a few vertical veins from which branches curve
      upwards and outwards towards the edge of the lamina. The secondary
      veins are connected by frequent anastomoses and agree very closely with
      those of <i>Glossopteris</i>. The lamina becomes narrower towards the base,
      which is either cuneate or in some cases slightly auriculate (<a href="#fig345">fig. 345</a>).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As I have elsewhere pointed out<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>, the presence or absence
    of a midrib is not in itself a character of real taxonomic
    importance. In the recent fern <i>Scolopendrium vulgare</i> the
    frond has a prominent midrib, while in <i>S. nigripes</i> there is no
    median rib. Mr Arber has expressed the opinion that “it is
    extremely doubtful whether the genus <i>Gangamopteris</i> should
    not be merged in <i>Glossopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>.” The retention of the two names
    is, however, convenient, and it would tend to confusion were
    we to carry to its logical conclusion the view that the recognised
    distinction between the two genera may not be a mark of
    generic difference.</p>

  <p><i>Gangamopteris</i> is confined to Palaeozoic strata, a fact which
    leads White<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> to speak of the Gangamopteris rather than of the
    Glossopteris Flora. It occurs in South America, South Africa,
    Australia, and India, extending as far north as Kashmir; it has
    been discovered by Amalitzky in Permian rocks of Russia<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>.
    The Russian rocks in which <i>Glossopteris</i> and <i>Gangamopteris</i>
    were found are no doubt of Permian age. In Australia, South
    Africa, Brazil and Argentina, and in the Indian Coal-fields,
    <i>Gangamopteris</i> is a characteristic genus of Lower Gondwana
    rocks. These strata are usually spoken of as Permo-Carboniferous
    in order to avoid the danger of attempting on insufficient
    data a precise correlation with European formations.</p>

  <p>Feistmantel speaks of <i>Gangamopteris</i> as most abundant in
    the Talchir-Karharbári beds, though it is represented also in
    the overlying Damuda series. In Australia the genus occurs in
    rocks which correspond in position and in their plant fossils
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>with the Talchir-Karharbári beds of India; similarly, in South
    Africa and South America the Gangamopteris beds are homotaxial
    with those of India and Australia. The leaf described
    by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> from Brazil as <i>Noeggerathia obovata</i> (the type-specimen
    is in the British Museum) is no doubt specifically
    identical with <i>Gangamopteris cyclopteroides</i> Feist.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> In a paper
    by Mr Hayden on Gangamopteris beds in the Vihi Valley,
    Kashmir, evidence is adduced in support of the conclusion that
    the rocks are “not younger than Upper Carboniferous and may
    belong to the base of that subdivision or even to the Middle
    Carboniferous<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>.” It would seem that <i>Gangamopteris</i> was a
    very widely spread genus during the latter part of the Carboniferous
    period in the vast Southern Continent to which the
    name Gondwana Land is often applied, and that it flourished in
    the Southern Flora during at least part of the Permian period:
    with other members of the Glossopteris Flora it migrated to the
    North where it has been preserved in Permian rocks of Northern
    Russia. The Glossopteris Flora must have had its birth in the
    Southern hemisphere. The conclusion seems inevitable that
    the leaves of <i>Glossopteris</i> and <i>Gangamopteris</i> in the shales and
    sandstones of India, South Africa, South America, and Australia
    are relics of the vegetation of a continent of which these regions
    are the <i>disjuncta membra</i>. Darwin wrote to his friend Hooker
    in 1881, “I have sometimes speculated whether there did not
    exist somewhere during long ages an extremely isolated continent,
    perhaps near the South Pole<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a>.” It is probable that
    <i>Gangamopteris</i> is one of the genera which flourished on this
    continent.</p>

  <p>This type agrees closely with <i>G. cyclopteroides</i> in size and
    in the form of the leaf, but it is distinguished by the flatter
    form of the arch formed by the lateral veins, by their greater
    inclination to the margin of the lamina, and by the more
    acutely pointed apex of the lamina. This species, though not
    very sharply distinguished from <i>G. cyclopteroides</i>, is important
    as coming from beds which have been assigned on other than
    palaeobotanical evidence to an Upper or possibly a Middle
    Carboniferous horizon<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>.</p>

  <p>We have no definite information in regard to the nature of
    the reproductive organs of <i>Gangamopteris</i>, but such evidence as
    there is supports the view expressed by Dr White<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> and shared
    by some other authors that <i>Gangamopteris</i> and <i>Glossopteris</i>
    should be assigned to the Pteridosperms. Despite the abundance
    of <i>Gangamopteris</i> leaves, no fertile specimen has been
    discovered. This negative evidence may prove to be as correct
    as that which led Stur<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> to exclude <i>Neuropteris</i>, <i>Alethopteris</i> and
    <i>Odontopteris</i> from the ferns. The only evidence of a positive
    kind is that furnished by Dr David White in his recent Report
    on the Palaeozoic Flora of South Brazil. This author describes
    some small Aphlebia-like leaves under two new generic names
    <i>Arberia</i><a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> and <i>Derbyella</i><a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>. The differences between the two sets
    of specimens, so far as can be determined from the reproductions
    of imperfect impressions, are slight, and it is by no means
    clear that a distinction of generic rank exists. These scale-leaves
    are on the average about 2 cm. in length; the lamina is
    oval or rounded and has more or less prominent lobes. In
    <i>Derbyella</i> there are indications of anastomosing veins. The
    specimens referred to <i>Arberia minasica</i> are, as White points
    out, very similar to the fossil described by Feistmantel from
    Lower Gondwana rocks of India as probably a portion of an
    inflorescence of <i>Noeggerathiopsis</i><a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>. Feistmantel’s specimen is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>represented in <a href="#fig346">fig. 346</a>: the curled lobes may have originally
    borne seeds. In the Brazilian examples the abruptly truncated
    lobes “bear evidence of separation from reproductive bodies.”
    An important point is the association of these scale-leaves with
    <i>Gangamopteris</i> fronds and with gymnospermous seeds of the
    <i>Samaropsis</i> type. On the leaves assigned to <i>Derbyella aurita</i>
    circular depressions occur at the base of the lobes which are
    described as probably due to sporangia.</p>

  <p>Dr White’s discovery gives us increased confidence in
    expressing the view that <i>Gangamopteris</i> bore its reproductive
    organs on specialised leaves very different from the sterile
    fronds; it also strengthens the suspicion that the genus is a
    member of the class of seed-bearing fern-like plants.</p>

  <h4 id="Lesleya">Lesleya.</h4>

  <p>This generic designation was instituted by Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> for
    simple oval-linear leaves from the Coal-Measures of Pennsylvania.
    The leaves so named are probably generically
    identical with the specimen doubtfully assigned by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a>
    to the Coal-Measures, and made by him the type of the genus
    <i>Cannophyllites</i> on the ground of a resemblance to the leaves of
    the recent flowering plant <i>Canna</i>. Fig. 347 illustrates the
    form of a <i>Lesleya</i> leaf from the Coal-basin of Gard, named by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>Grand’Eury <i>L. simplicinervis</i><a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>, a type in which the veins are
    frequently unbranched and not repeatedly forked as in most
    examples of the genus (<a href="#fig329">fig. 329</a>, C). The features of the genus
    are, the oval-linear or lanceolate shape of the presumably simple
    frond, its entire or, in one species at least (<i>L. Delafondi</i>, Zeill.),
    finely dentate margin, the stout rachis giving off at a very
    acute angle numerous dichotomously branched secondary veins.
    In <i>L. Delafondi</i> (<a href="#fig329">fig. 329</a>, C), described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> from the
    Lower Permian of Autun, the frond may reach a length of
    more than 20 cm. and a breadth of 8 cm. Similar species are
    represented by <i>L. ensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> from the coal-field of Commentry,
    and <i>L. grandis</i><a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> from Upper Carboniferous rocks of North
    America. The genus is characteristic of Upper Carboniferous
    and Lower Permian strata: the form of the leaf and the direction
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>of the secondary veins suggest comparison with <i>Glossopteris</i>,
    but in <i>Lesleya</i> there are no cross-connexions between the veins.
    Nothing is known as to the fructification, a fact which naturally
    evokes the opinion that the genus is a Pteridosperm<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> and not a
    true fern. Some years before the discovery of Pteridosperms,
    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> suggested that <i>Lesleya</i> might be a Gymnosperm;
    his opinion being based on the woody nature of the rachis and
    on the simple venation of <i>Lesleya simplicinervis</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Neuropteridium">Neuropteridium.</h4>

  <p>In their monograph of fossil plants from the Bunter Series
    of the Vosges, Schimper and Mougeot<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> described some pinnate
    leaves of ferns as species of the genus <i>Neuropteris</i>. In 1869
    Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> placed these in a new sub-genus <i>Neuropteridium</i>, in
    order to draw attention to the fact that their fronds appear
    to be simply pinnate and not bipinnate or tripinnate as in
    <i>Neuropteris</i>. The type-species of <i>Neuropteridium</i> is <i>N. grandifolia</i>
    Sch. and Moug. from the Bunter Sandstones of the Vosges.
    The genus includes Triassic European species and the widely
    distributed Permo-Carboniferous species from Brazil<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> originally
    described by Carruthers as <i>Odontopteris Plantiana</i>. It is
    probable that some Carboniferous plants, particularly species
    from the lower members of the formation, referred to the genus
    <i>Cardiopteris</i>, are not genetically distinct from the Indian and
    southern hemisphere type <i>Neuropteridium validum</i> (= <i>Odontopteris
    Plantiana</i>).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds pinnate, linear; a broad rachis bears pinnules which may be
      either semicircular or broadly linear with an entire or lobed margin. The
      longer pinnules may exceed 6 cm. in length. The pinnules agree with
      those of <i>Neuropteris</i> in being attached by the median portion of the lamina
      and not by the whole base, which is more or less auriculate. In some
      cases the repeatedly forked veins diverge from the centre of the pinnule
      base; in others there is a midrib which persists for a short distance only,
      and in some species the more persistent median vein gives the segments a
      closer resemblance to those of <i>Neuropteris</i>. Fructification unknown, with
      the exception of obscure indications of sporangia (?) on the fertile leaves of
      a Triassic species.</p>

  <p>The specimen represented in <a href="#fig348">fig. 348</a> illustrates the main
    features of <i>Neuropteridium validum</i>. This species is referred to
    by Dr White<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> as <i>N. Plantianum</i> on the ground of priority, and
    with a view to perpetuate the name of the English engineer
    Nathaniel Plant who discovered the species in a Brazilian Coal-field
    in the province of Rio Grande do Sul. Feistmantel’s specific
    name is however retained as being much better known. An
    examination of Mr Plant’s specimen in the British Museum
    led me<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> to speak of the Brazilian species as identical with
    <i>N. validum</i> described by Feistmantel from Lower Gondwana
    rocks of India. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> had previously drawn attention to the
    resemblance between the two sets of specimens. The frond of
    <i>N. validum</i> may exceed 50 cm. in length. The lower pinnules
    may be entire and semicircular in form while the upper and
    larger segments, which may reach a length of 5 or 6 cm., are
    characterised by broad lobes (<a href="#fig348">fig. 348</a>).</p>

  <p>This type is represented in the flora of the Talchir-Karharbári
    series (Lower Gondwana) of India<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>, in Permo-Carboniferous
    rocks of Brazil and Argentine<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a>, and in the
    sandstones of Vereeniging on the borders of the Transvaal
    and Cape Colony. It is a characteristic member of the Glossopteris
    Flora and occurs in association with <i>Glossopteris</i> and
    <i>Gangamopteris</i>.</p>

  <h6><i>Neuropteridium intermedium</i> (Schimper). Fig. 349.</h6>

  <p>This species has been figured by Schimper and Mougeot<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>
    from the Bunter of the Vosges and more fully described by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>Blanckenhorn<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> from the Bunter beds of Commern. The pinnate
    leaves reach a length of 65 cm.; the lower semicircular pinnules
    pass gradually into broadly linear segments characterised by an
    auriculate base and a Neuropteris type of venation (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>,
    D′, E). In the example reproduced in <a href="#fig349">fig. 349</a> from one of
    Blanckenhorn’s figures, the fronds are attached to a short and
    thick rhizome bearing roots and portions of old petioles.</p>

      <i>Neuropteridium intermedium</i> (Schimp.). (After Blanckenhorn. ¼ nat. size.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>An example of another Triassic species is afforded by <i>Neuropteridium
    grandifolium</i> Schimp. and Moug., which agrees very
    closely with <i>N. validum</i> in the size and shape of the pinnules.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>The occurrence in Lower Mesozoic European rocks of fronds
    hardly distinguishable from the older southern species may be
    regarded as favourable to the view already expressed, that some
    at least of the Permo-Carboniferous plants migrated north of
    the Equator. The resemblance between the Vosges Triassic
    species of <i>Schizoneura</i><a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> and the examples of this genus recorded
    from the Lower Gondwana rocks of India affords additional
    evidence of a northern migration.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the reproductive organs of <i>Neuropteridium</i>
    is practically <i>nil</i>. There is no doubt that Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> and
    Blanckenhorn<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> are correct in regarding the Bunter fronds
    assigned by Schimper and Mougeot to the genus <i>Crematopteris</i>
    as the fertile leaves of <i>Neuropteridium intermedium</i> or some
    other species from the same horizon. These fronds bear crowded
    pinnules similar to those of <i>Neuropteridium intermedium</i>,
    <i>N. Voltzii</i><a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a>, and other species, exhibiting on the exposed surface
    numerous carbonaceous spots which may be the remains of
    sporangia.</p>

  <h4 id="Cardiopteris">Cardiopteris.</h4>

  <p>Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> applied this generic name to Lower Carboniferous
    fronds of a simple-pinnate habit which had previously been
    described as species of <i>Cyclopteris</i>. <i>Cardiopteris frondosa</i> may
    serve as a typical example. This species, originally described by
    Goeppert as <i>Cyclopteris frondosa</i> (<a href="#fig350">fig. 350</a>), is recorded from
    Lower Carboniferous rocks in the Vosges district<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> in Silesia,
    Moravia<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>, and Thuringia<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a>. The pinnules, which are attached
    in opposite pairs to a broad rachis, vary in length from 2 to
    10 cm. and have a breadth of 2 to 8 cm.; in manner of attachment
    and venation they agree with those of <i>Neuropteridium validum</i>.
    The venation is very clearly shown in a drawing of some large
    pinnules figured by Stur<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>.</p>

  <p>The specimen of <i>Cardiopteris frondosa</i>, a portion of which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>is shown in <a href="#fig350">fig. 350</a> on a slightly reduced scale, was originally
    figured by Schimper from an unusually good example in the
    Strassburg Museum. Schimper’s drawing hardly does justice
    to the original specimen.</p>

  <p>A frond bearing rather narrower pinnules, alternately
    placed on the rachis, which Fritsch has described as <i>Cardiopteris
    Hochstetterii</i> var. <i>franconica</i> from the Culm of Thuringia, bears
    a close resemblance to <i>Neuropteridium validum</i> but differs in
    the entire margin of the pinnules. An Upper Carboniferous
    species from Russia described by Grigoriew<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> as <i>Neuropteris</i>, cf.
    <i>cordata</i> var. <i>densineura</i>, represents another form of similar habit.</p>

      <i>Cardiopteris frondosa</i> (Goepp.). (¾ nat. size. After Schimper.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Schuster<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> has recently proposed a new generic name
    <i>Ulvopteris</i> for a fragment of a pinna from the Coal-Measures
    of Dudweiler in Germany bearing large pinnules, which he
    compares with those of <i>Cardiopteris</i> and species of <i>Rhacopteris</i>.
    The specimen appears to be indistinguishable from some of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>those already referred to as conforming to <i>Neuropteridium</i>, and
    it is difficult to recognise any reason for the creation of a new
    generic name.</p>

  <p>We cannot hope to arrive at any satisfactory decision in
    regard to the precise affinity between <i>Neuropteridium validum</i>
    and species referred to <i>Cardiopteris</i> and other genera so long as
    portions of sterile fronds are the only tests at our disposal. It
    is difficult to determine whether a specimen consisting of an
    axis bearing pinnules represents a large pinna of a bipinnate
    frond or if it is a complete pinnate leaf. There is, however,
    no adequate reason for supposing that the presumably
    pinnate fronds from the Gondwana Land rocks are generically
    distinct from the Lower Carboniferous European species
    <i>Cardiopteris frondosa</i>. Granting the probability that both
    genera are Pteridosperms and closely allied to one another, the
    two generic names may be retained on the ground of long usage
    and in default of satisfactory evidence confirmatory of generic
    identity. <i>Cardiopteris</i> would thus stand for a type of frond
    characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous strata of Europe,
    while <i>Neuropteridium</i> is retained for the Southern species
    <i>N. validum</i>, and for others from the Trias of the Vosges.</p>

  <h4 id="Aphlebia">Aphlebia.</h4>

  <p>This name was proposed by Presl<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> for large leaf-like
    impressions having a pinnate or pinnatifid form and characterised
    by a confused irregular type of venation, or by a fine superficial
    striation or wrinkling which simulates veins. Gutbier had
    previously described similar fossils as <i>Fucoides</i>, and other
    authors have described Aphlebiae as species of <i>Rhacophyllum</i>,
    <i>Schizopteris</i>, and other genera<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a>. The term <i>Aphlebia</i> is retained,
    not as denoting a distinct genus but (i) as a descriptive name
    for detached leafy structures similar to those figured by Presl,
    which are now recognised as laminar appendages of the petioles
    of ferns or fern-like fronds, and (ii) as an epithet for highly
    modified pinnules which frequently occur at the base of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>primary pinnae of Pecopteroid and Sphenopteroid fronds
    (e.g. <i>Dactylotheca plumosa</i>, <a href="#fig293">fig. 293</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>.</p>

  <p>Modified pinnules, similar in their reduced and deeply
    dissected lamina to those represented in <a href="#fig293">fig. 293</a>, are frequently
    found at the base of the primary pinnae of Palaeozoic species of
    <i>Sphenopteris</i> and other genera of Pteridosperms or ferns, including
    members of the Coenopterideae. Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> gives a list of various
    types of Aphlebiae in his paper on these organs. A striking
    case has recently been described by Zeiller in a French Upper
    Carboniferous species, <i>Sphenopteris Matheti</i><a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>. It would seem
    that the larger examples of Aphlebiae are more frequently
    associated with the compound leaves of Pteridosperms than
    with those of Ferns<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>.</p>

  <p>As examples of the larger types of Aphlebiae reference may
    be made to <i>Aphlebia crispa</i> (Gutb.)<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>, which reaches a length of
    nearly 60 cm. and has the form of a more or less triangular
    pinnate leaf divided into decurrent deeply lobed segments, to
    a similar species represented by <i>A. Germari</i> (= <i>Schizopteris
    lactuca</i> Germ.)<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> which simulates the leaves of endive (<i>Cichorium
    endivia</i> L.), and to some large forms figured by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> as
    species of <i>Schizopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>Aphlebiae such as that figured by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> as <i>Rhacophyllum
    crispum</i>, with narrow ultimate segments, might easily be
    mistaken for the impressions of an alga.</p>

  <p>The term <i>Aphlebia</i> may be applied also to the Cyclopteroid
    pinnules on the petioles of some species of <i>Neuropteris</i>, <i>Odontopteris</i>
    and <i>Archaeopteris</i>. Goebel<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> has referred to the application
    by Potonié and other authors of the term Aphlebioid to the
    pinnules which serve as bud-protecting organs in recent fronds
    of <i>Gleichenia</i> (<a href="#fig226">fig. 226</a>, p. 290); he expresses the opinion that it
    is superfluous and misleading to make use of a special designation
    for structures which are undoubtedly modified pinnules.
    In the case of fossils it is, however, convenient to employ
    the term <i>Aphlebia</i> as a descriptive name for modified pinnules
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>or stipular structures which cannot be connected with definite
    species of fronds. It is clear that some Aphlebiod leaflets, such
    as those of <i>Dactylotheca</i>, served as protective organs for the
    unexpanded pinnae<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>, and in all probability the large Aphlebiae
    served the same purpose as the fleshy stipules of <i>Angiopteris</i>
    and <i>Marattia</i> which cover the uncoiled fronds. The pinnatifid
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>scale-leaves of considerable size (<a href="#fig351">fig. 351</a>) which occur in the
    leaf-axils or as ochrea-like stipules on the fronds of <i>Gunnera</i>
    (a tropical and subtropical Dicotyledonous genus) bear a very
    close resemblance to some Palaeozoic Aphlebiae, e.g. <i>Aphlebia
      crispa</i> (Gutb.). The recent and fossil scale-leaves may be
    regarded as similar in function as in form; moreover the delicate
    coiled fronds of Palaeozoic Pteridosperms or ferns, like those of
    some recent flowering plants, may have been kept moist by a
    secretion of mucilage. The pinnatifid stipules of <i>Marattia
      fraxinea</i> (<a href="#fig241">fig. 241</a>, B, p. 317) resemble certain fossil Aphlebiae,
    and the wrinkled surface of the recent stipules presents an
    appearance similar to that which in some fossil forms has been
    erroneously described as veining. It is not improbable that
    mantle-leaves of such recent ferns as <i>Polypodium quercifolium</i>
    (<a href="#fig234">fig. 234</a>, M, p. 303) are comparable with some fossil Aphlebiae
    which may have served as humus-collectors for Palaeozoic
    epiphytes.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 351.
      Scale-leaf of <i>Gunnera manicata</i>. (Slightly reduced. M.S.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The filiform appendages on the petioles of the recent fern
    <i>Hemitelia capensis</i> (<a href="#fig235">fig. 235</a>, p. 304) have often been compared
    with the aphlebioid leaflets of fossil fronds.</p>

  <p>Potonié who has discussed the nature of Aphlebiae regards
    them as vestiges of a once continuous lamina, which formed a
    winged border to the branched axes of more primitive forms of
    fronds. It is possible that the pinnules between the pinnae on
    the rachis of <i>Archaeopteris</i> and the Cyclopteroid leaflets of
    <i>Neuropteris</i> and <i>Odontopteris</i> may have the morphological
    significance attributed to them by Potonié. In some cases
    it is probable that the Aphlebiae, whether vestiges or not,
    served the purpose of protecting either the whole frond or
    individual pinnae. Aphlebiae, though especially characteristic
    of Palaeozoic leaves, are occasionally met with in the form of
    modified pinnules at the base of the primary pinnae on
    Mesozoic ferns, e.g. in <i>Coniopteris hymenophylloides</i><a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>.</p>

  <p>In some fern fronds the lowest pinnule of each pinna
    differs in shape or size from the normal ultimate segments,
    but it would be almost affectation to extend the use of the
    term <i>Aphlebia</i> to such pinnules. The Jurassic species
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span><i>Cladophlebis lobifolia</i> (Phill.) is a case in point<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>. In this
    fern, which some authors speak of, without sufficient reason,
    as <i>Dicksonia lobifolia</i><a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>, the lowest pinnule is large and different
    in shape from the others.</p>

  <h4 id="Sphenopteris">Sphenopteris.</h4>

  <p><i>Sphenopteris</i> is one of the many generic names which we
    owe to Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>. It is the generic designation used for a
    great number of Palaeozoic and later fronds, most of which are
    those of true ferns while some Palaeozoic species are undoubted
    Pteridosperms. The genus, which is purely provisional, includes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>members of widely different families possessing pinnules of the
    same general type, such as is represented in some recent species
    of <i>Davallia</i>, <i>Asplenium</i>, and other ferns.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The fronds of <i>Sphenopteris</i> may be bipinnate, tripinnate, or quadripinnate;
      the rachis may be dichotomously branched or the branching may
      be of the pinnate type characteristic of most recent ferns. The pinnules
      are small; they vary considerably in shape even in a single frond, but the
      chief characteristics are: the lobed lamina, contracted and often wedge-shaped
      at the base (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>), the dichotomously branched veins radiating
      from the base or given off from a median rib at an acute angle. The
      lamina may be divided into a few bluntly rounded lobes (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, C) or
      deeply dissected into linear or cuneate segments (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, A, B, E).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Examples of Sphenopteroid leaves have already been
    described under the genera <i>Coniopteris</i>, <i>Onychiopsis</i>, <i>Ruffordia</i>,
    etc. Among the numerous examples of <i>Sphenopteris</i> species
    from the Carboniferous rocks mention may be made of <i>Sphenopteris
    obtusiloba</i> Brogn.<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, A–C), which occurs in the
    Middle and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>. This type is
    characterised by the almost orbicular, oval or triangular pinnules
    which may reach a length of 15 mm.; they are occasionally
    entire, but more usually divided into 3 to 5 rounded lobes. The
    forked veins radiate from the base of the pinnule. The rachis
    may be dichotomously branched. Fructification unknown.</p>

  <p>The species <i>S. furcata</i> Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>, characteristic of the Middle
    and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, E), is referred
    to under Stur’s genus <i>Diplotmema</i><a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> in which it is included
    by some authors solely because of the dichotomous habit of
    branching of the pinnae.</p>

  <p>The pinna represented in <a href="#fig353">fig. 353</a> illustrates a similar type
    of pinnule. This species, which is very common in the Calciferous
    Sandstone of Scotland, was described by Lindley and Hutton
    as <i>Sphenopteris affinis</i><a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>.</p>

  <p>The fronds of <i>Sphenopteris affinis</i> were discovered by
    Mr Peach<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> in a fertile condition, but he regarded the reproductive
    organs as those of a plant parasitic on the <i>Sphenopteris</i> fronds.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> substituted Stur’s genus <i>Calymmatotheca</i> for <i>Sphenopteris</i>
    on the ground that the sporangia figured by Peach
    under the name <i>Staphylopteris Peachii</i> bear a close resemblance
    to the organs which Stur described as valves of an indusium in
    his species <i>Calymmatotheca Stangeri</i><a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a>. An examination of Stur’s
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>specimens by Miss Benson<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> and by Prof. Oliver and Dr Scott
    has confirmed Stur’s interpretation of the appendages at the
    tips of the fertile pinnae as valves of an indusial or cupular
    structure. The superficially similar bodies on the fertile pinnae
    of <i>S. affinis</i> are however true sporangia, and cannot legitimately
    be included in the genus <i>Calymmatotheca</i> as described by Stur.
    For this reason Miss Benson institutes a new genus <i>Telangium</i>,
    the type-species of which, <i>T. Scotti</i> from the Lower Coal-Measures
    of Lancashire, is based on petrified material. The
    Scotch species <i>Sphenopteris affinis</i> (= <i>Calymmatotheca affinis</i> of
    Kidston) is also transferred to <i>Telangium</i>; the sporangia are
    considered by Miss Benson to be microsporangia. This with other
    species is no doubt correctly included in the Pteridosperms.
    A complete frond of <i>Sphenopteris affinis</i>, showing a regular
    dichotomy of the main axes, is represented by an admirable
    drawing in Hugh Miller’s <i>Testimony of the Rocks</i><a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Some of the Palaeozoic species of <i>Sphenopteris</i> probably
    represent the fronds of true ferns, but others are known to have
    been borne by Pteridosperms. <i>S. Hoeninghausi</i> (<a href="#fig290">fig. 290</a>, C,
    p. 399) is the foliage of <i>Lyginodendron</i>, and Scott<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> speaks of
    three species, <i>S. dissecta</i>, <i>S. elegans</i>, and <i>S. Linkii</i> as the leaves
    of <i>Heterangium</i>. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> has recorded the occurrence in
    French Coal-Measures of seeds in association with other
    Sphenopteroid fronds.</p>

  <h4 id="Mariopteris">Mariopteris, Diplotmema, Palmatopteris.</h4>

  <p>The discovery of sporangia on the fronds of several Palaeozoic
    species of <i>Sphenopteris</i> and <i>Pecopteris</i> has led to the
    institution of new generic names, which indicate an advance in
    knowledge beyond the stage implied by the use of those
    provisional designations based solely on the form and venation
    of the pinnules. Other names have been created by authors in
    place of <i>Sphenopteris</i> and <i>Pecopteris</i> on the ground that a
    striking feature in the mode of branching of fronds is sufficiently
    important to justify generic recognition even in the absence
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>of fertile specimens. As examples of designations based primarily
    on the branch-system of compound leaves, the genera
    <i>Mariopteris</i>, <i>Diplotmema</i>, and <i>Palmatopteris</i> may be briefly
    considered (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a> A–C). Dr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> is of opinion that the
    creation of new genera for purely vegetative characters of fronds
    is of no real advantage, and he prefers to retain the older
    provisional names for species known only in the sterile condition.
    On the other hand, if we are sufficiently familiar with specimens
    large enough to enable us to recognise a well-defined morphological
    character, it may serve a useful purpose to employ a
    generic designation for features which may have a phylogenetic
    value. A comparative examination of Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and
    recent compound fronds, including both Pteridosperms and true
    ferns, brings to light certain distinguishing features characteristic
    of the older types which, as Potonié maintains<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a>, point to
    the derivation of the pinnate habit from a primitive dichotomous
    system of branching. For a more complete discussion of
    this question reference should be made to Potonié’s suggestive
    papers. Among recent ferns <i>Matonia</i> and <i>Dipteris</i>, two
    survivals from the past, afford instances of fronds with a
    branching system of the dichotomous type.</p>

  <p>Similarly, in <i>Gleichenia</i>, <i>Lygodium</i>, and more rarely in
    species of Polypodiaceae (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Davallia aculeata</i>, <a href="#fig232">fig. 232</a>)
    dichotomy is a striking feature of the fronds. In the great
    majority of recent ferns the fronds have assumed a pinnate
    habit. Among Palaeozoic fern-like fronds dichotomous branching
    of the main rachis and of the pinnae is much more common.
    Potonié draws attention to several other features which
    distinguish Palaeozoic fronds from the majority of later
    species: the frequent occurrence of pinnules borne directly on
    the main rachis (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, D), and of modified pinnules or
    Aphlebiae on the rachis and petiole, are characters to which he
    attributes an evolutionary significance. The main point is that
    a comparative examination of leaf-form affords evidence in
    favour of the view that the modern type of frond, with its
    naked rachis bearing two rows of pinnae, has been derived from
    a less specialised type in which the distinction between the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>parts of the leaf is much less evident. The primitive leaf was
    probably a dichotomously branched axis provided with a
    continuous lamina which eventually became broken up into
    separate lobes or pinnules.</p>

  <p>As the dichotomy of the frond became less regular, a pinnate
    habit was acquired, as is clearly seen in many Palaeozoic types
    which constitute connecting links between forked and pinnate
    fronds (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, D). The Aphlebiae may be remnants of the
    once-continuous lamina on the petiole, and the normal pinnules
    borne on the rachis may be regarded as the attributes of fronds
    in which the division of physiological labour had not reached
    the stage which characterises the leaves of recent ferns.</p>

  <h5><i>Mariopteris.</i></h5>

  <p>This name, which is due to Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a>, is applied by him to
    Palaeozoic fronds characterised by a double bifurcation of the
    rachis of the primary pinnae. <i>Mariopteris muricata</i> (= <i>Pecopteris
    muricata</i> Schloth.) may be taken as the type of the genus.
    This species is common in the Lower and Middle Coal-Measures
    of Britain and rare in the Upper Coal-Measures<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>. It is
    described by Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> as one of the most polymorphic and
    widely distributed Coal-Measure species. The pinnules as
    seen in <a href="#fig364">fig. 364</a>, B, are of the Sphenopteroid type. No fertile
    specimens are known, but it is significant that Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>
    has recorded the association of <i>Mariopteris muricata</i> and seeds.</p>

  <p>The main rachis gives off alternate naked branches, each of
    which bifurcates at its apex into two short naked axes, and these
    are again forked, the ultimate branches having the form of
    bipinnate pinnae provided with large Sphenopteroid pinnules
    (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, B). Zeiller includes in <i>Mariopteris</i> some species
    which Stur<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> referred to his genus <i>Diplotmema</i>. Possibly some
    of the Palaeozoic fronds with a zigzag rachis may have been
    climbers like <i>Lygodium</i>.</p>

  <h5><i>Diplotmema.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name is employed by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> and other authors
    in a more restricted sense than that in which it was originally
    used by Stur. The Upper Carboniferous species <i>Sphenopteris
    furcata</i> Brongn. (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, E) may serve as the type. This species
    occurs in the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>The main rachis gives off branches as in <i>Mariopteris</i>, but in
    <i>Diplotmema</i> each naked lateral branch is forked at its apex
    into two opposite pinnae bearing deeply dissected Sphenopteroid
    pinnules. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> and Stur have recorded fertile specimens
    of <i>Diplotmema</i>, but in no case have actual sporangia been
    discovered. In the species <i>Diplotmema Zeilleri</i> Stur (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>,
    C, C′) two Aphlebiae occur at the base of each secondary axis<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a>.
    It has been pointed out by Potonié that in <i>Diplotmema furcatum</i>
    the equal dichotomy of the lateral branches is not characteristic
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>of the frond as a whole. In the case of branches higher on the
    rachis the dichotomy becomes unequal and the forked axis is
    gradually replaced by a simple pinna (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, A). For this type
    of frond, Potonié proposed the generic name <i>Palmatopteris</i> in
    place of <i>Diplotmema</i>, which he discards. The long comparatively
    slender rachis of <i>P. furcata</i> suggests comparison with
    the liane species of <i>Lygodium</i><a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Cephalotheca">Cephalotheca.</h4>

  <p>This genus was proposed by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> for some peculiar
    bipinnate fertile fronds from the Upper Devonian rocks of
    Bear Island. The pinnae bear slender forked ultimate segments
    represented by a few detached fragments (<a href="#fig355">fig. 355</a>, B),
    associated with the rachises. The fertile pinnae are given off
    in opposite pairs from the main axis over which they are
    concrescent (<a href="#fig355">fig. 355</a>, A). A mop-like cluster of sporangia is
    borne on the lower surface and close to the base of a fertile
    pinna: the exannulate sporangia are compared with those of
    <i>Scolecopteris</i>. Nathorst compares <i>Cephalotheca</i> with a Belgian
    species of Upper Devonian age described by Crépin<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> as
    <i>Rhacophyton condrusorum</i> and by Gilkinet<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> as <i>Sphenopteris
    condrusorum</i>. A similar fossil is also described by Baily<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> as
    <i>Filicites lineatus</i> from the Kitorkan Grits of Ireland.</p>

  <p>The position of <i>Cephalotheca</i> cannot be definitely determined
    from the available data, but it is more probable that it was
    a seed-bearing Pteridosperm and not a true fern. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a>
    has recently expressed the same opinion.</p>

  <h4 id="Thinnfeldia">Thinnfeldia.</h4>

  <p>The genus <i>Thinnfeldia</i>, founded by Ettingshausen in 1852<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>
    on some Hungarian Liassic specimens, though frequently included
    in the Filicales, cannot be said to occupy that position
    by virtue of any well-authenticated filicinean features. It is by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>no means improbable that many of the species referred to this
    genus are closely allied to Palaeozoic Pteridosperms.</p>

  <p><i>Thinnfeldia</i> may be briefly defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds simple and pinnatifid, pinnate or bipinnate: rachis broad and
      occasionally dichotomously branched. Pinnules often fleshy or coriaceous;
      broadly linear, entire or lobed, provided with a midrib from which simple
      or forked secondary veins are given off at an acute angle: or the laminae
      may be short and broad without a midrib and traversed by several
      slightly divergent and forked veins.</p>

    <p>No satisfactory evidence of reproductive organs has so far been
      adduced.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The genus is chiefly characteristic of Upper Triassic, Rhaetic,
    and Jurassic floras, though it was in all probability represented
    in Permian floras. Several species, many of which are valueless,
    are recorded also from Cretaceous and Tertiary formations.
    Search should be made for fertile specimens or for evidence
    as to the association of seeds with <i>Thinnfeldia</i> fronds.</p>

  <p>Some Permian fossils from Kansas which Sellards<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> has
    made the type of a new genus, <i>Glenopteris</i>, appear to be
    indistinguishable generically from leaves of Lower Mesozoic
    age universally recognised as typical examples of <i>Thinnfeldia</i>.</p>

  <h6><i>Thinnfeldia odontopteroides</i> (Morris)<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>. <a href="#fig356">Figs. 356–358</a>.</h6>

  <p>This is a very variable species as regards the shape and size
    of the ultimate segments and their venation. It is a type of
    extended geographical range characteristic of Rhaetic or Upper
    Triassic rocks in Australia, South Africa, India, South America,
    and various European localities.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Frond bipinnate; the broad rachis may be dichotomously branched.
      Pinnules with a thick lamina which may be almost semicircular in form,
      deltoid, broadly oval or broadly linear, and often confluent at the base.
      Short and broad pinnules occur on some fronds directly attached to the
      main rachis between the pinnae. The longer and narrower pinnules
      (<a href="#fig356">fig. 356</a>, C), resembling those of the Palaeozoic genus <i>Alethopteris</i>, have a
      well-defined midrib, while the smaller segments are characterised by
      several slightly divergent veins which spring directly from the rachis
      (<a href="#fig356">fig. 356</a>, A). Epidermal cells polygonal or, above the veins, rectangular
      in shape; stomata, which are slightly sunk, occur on both the upper and
      lower epidermis. Fertile specimens unknown.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

  <p>The portion of a lobed pinnule shown in <a href="#fig356">fig. 356</a>, B,
    illustrates a form of segment intermediate between the linear
    type with a midrib and a row of shorter pinnules without
    a median vein. Fig. 356, D, represents another instance of
    variation in the arrangement of the veins in segments of
    different sizes. Various specific and generic names have been
    assigned to Thinnfeldia fronds of Rhaetic age on the ground of
    the occurrence of pinnules longer and narrower than those
    usually associated with <i>T. odontopteroides</i>; but in view of the
    range of variation met with in a single leaf it is advisable to
    extend rather than to restrict the boundary of what we are
    pleased to regard as a specific type.</p>

    smaller leaf with pinnules of the linear type, some of which
    are partially divided into shorter pinnules with forked veins.

  <h6><i>Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis</i>, Ettingshausen. Figs. <a href="#fig359">359</a>, <a href="#fig360">360</a>, C.</h6>

  <p>Under this name Ettingshausen described the type-specimen
    of the genus from Lower Lias strata at Steierdorf in Hungary.
    He assigned the plant to the Coniferae on the ground of a
    resemblance of the pinnules to the phylloclades of <i>Phyllocladus.
    Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis</i> bears a close resemblance to <i>T. odontopteroides</i>,
    but the pinnules are usually longer and narrower,
    as shown in the English specimen from the Lower Lias of
    Dorsetshire represented in <a href="#fig359">fig. 359</a>. The darker margin of the
    pinnules shown in <a href="#fig360">fig. 360</a>, C, gives the impression of a revolute
    lamina, but a microscopical examination points to a thicker
    cuticle at the edge of the segments.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The species is recorded from Jurassic rocks of France, Germany,
    Italy, India, Australia, and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a>.</p>

  <p>Palaeobotanical literature contains numerous records of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>Jurassic, Cretaceous and some Tertiary species referred to
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i>, but many of these are probably not generically
    identical with <i>T. odontopteroides</i> or <i>T. rhomboidalis</i>. Mr Berry<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a>
    in a paper on <i>The American species referred to Thinnfeldia</i>
    concludes that the genus is “a rather indefinite one ... and
    badly in need of revision.” He regards the Middle and Upper
    Cretaceous American species as Conifers related to <i>Phyllocladus</i>
    and probably forming a link between the Podocarpeae and
    Taxeae: for these forms he proposes the generic name <i>Protophyllocladus</i>.
    The opinion has been expressed elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> that
    this “problematical<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>” genus rests on an unsatisfactory basis;
    the available data do not justify the use of a name which
    implies the existence in North American Cretaceous floras of
    a type related to the New Zealand and Tasmanian Conifer
    <i>Phyllocladus</i>. We are not in a position to assign a single
    species of <i>Thinnfeldia</i> to the Filicales or the Gymnosperms.</p>

  <p>A leaflet from Jurassic rocks of Poland figured by Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>
    shows what this author regards as the impression of a
    circular sorus: no sporangia have been found. A specimen
    in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>, which is said to come from Rhaetic
    beds in Queensland, shows a row of contiguous polygonal
    prominences on each side of the midrib which resemble the
    sori of a fern; but until sporangia are discovered we cannot
    determine the precise nature of this apparently fertile frond.</p>

  <p>A species described by Fontaine<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> from the Potomac beds
    (Wealden-Jurassic) of North America as <i>Thinnfeldia variabilis</i>
    affords a good example of a plant which cannot be identified
    with any degree of confidence either as a fern or a seed-bearing
    type. Mr Berry draws attention to the former application of
    this name by Velenovský to a distinct Lower Cretaceous
    Bohemian species and proposes for Fontaine’s plant the name
    <i>T. Fontainei</i>; he maintains that no one has doubted the fern-nature
    of the Potomac plant. <i>T. variabilis</i> may indeed be a
    fern, but the evidence is not such as to preclude legitimate
    doubts as to the correctness of this suggestion. Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>in referring to Schenk’s view that <i>Thinnfeldia</i> and its allies
    may represent a group intermediate between Ferns and Gymnosperms,
    admits that it is a possible supposition; he is, however,
    inclined to consider <i>Lomatopteris</i> and <i>Cycadopteris</i>, “genera
    especially comparable with <i>Thinnfeldia</i>” as more probably
    ferns.</p>

  <p>At this point we may conveniently consider a series of
    genera which occupy an equally uncertain position and bear
    a very close resemblance to <i>Thinnfeldia</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Lomatopteris">Lomatopteris.</h4>

  <p>The generic name <i>Lomatopteris</i> was proposed by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>
    for some bipinnate fronds originally described by Kurr<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> from
    Jurassic rocks of Württemberg as <i>Odontopteris (?) jurensis</i>
    (<a href="#fig360">fig. 360</a>, A). I have elsewhere expressed the opinion<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> that
    this German species may be identical with <i>Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis</i>
    Ett. Kurr’s type-specimen, a portion of which is
    reproduced in <a href="#fig360">fig. 360</a>, A, consists of a frond or large pinna
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>characterised by a prominent and broad rachis giving off
    alternate linear pinnae bearing bluntly rounded, contiguous
    and basally concrescent pinnules having a thick or revolute
    border and a central rib. The lateral veins are visible in the
    ultimate segments of Kurr’s fossil. Saporta<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> has described
    several species, which he refers to Schimper’s genus, from
    French Jurassic strata: it is, however, difficult to recognise
    some of the examples represented in his illustrations as specifically
    distinct forms. This author notices the resemblance of
    <i>Lomatopteris</i> to <i>Thinnfeldia</i>, not only in habit but in the
    structure of the epidermal cells<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>. In <i>Lomatopteris</i> and in
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i> the cells have straight and not sinuous walls
    and the slightly sunken stomata are surrounded by a ring
    of epidermal cells. Salfeld<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> has recently described portions
    of fronds from Jurassic rocks of South-West Germany, which
    he identifies as <i>Lomatopteris jurensis</i>. He disagrees with my
    view that <i>Lomatopteris</i> does not differ sufficiently from <i>Thinnfeldia</i>
    to be accorded generic autonomy, chiefly on the ground
    that the folded-over edge of the pinnules is a distinguishing
    feature of <i>Lomatopteris</i>. There is, however, no difference, in
    appearance at least, between the leaflets of some species of
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i>, e.g. <i>T. rhomboidalis</i> from Liassic rocks of England<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a>,
    and those referred to <i>Lomatopteris</i>. In a later paper, Salfeld<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>
    describes some Portlandian fragments from North Germany as
    <i>Lomatopteris Schimperi</i>, identifying them with a Wealden fossil
    of somewhat doubtful affinity, which Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> makes the type
    of his species. The Portlandian specimens are described as
    tripinnate, with thick decurrent obtusely terminated pinnules
    with a revolute edge. The general form of the frond is very
    similar to that of <i>L. jurensis</i>. Salfeld publishes a photograph
    of a large specimen which he describes as fertile and a drawing
    of a piece of a pinna: the latter is reproduced in <a href="#fig360">fig. 360</a>, B.
    He speaks of sori occurring in two rows, probably attached to
    lateral veins, in the groove between the midrib and the revolute
    edge of the lamina. The sporangia are described as “nicht
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>näher bekannt<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>.” An examination of the figures reveals
    nothing as to the nature of the “sori.” The specimens are
    considered by Salfeld to afford decisive evidence against the
    view that <i>Lomatopteris</i> and <i>Thinnfeldia</i> are generically identical.
    Nothing has so far been published which constitutes a valid
    argument in favour of retaining Schimper’s generic name.</p>

  <h4 id="Cycadopteris">Cycadopteris.</h4>

  <p>Zigno<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> founded the genus <i>Cycadopteris</i> on Italian Jurassic
    impressions regarded by Schimper as indistinguishable from
    <i>Lomatopteris</i>. As Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> points out, the supposed
    sori of <i>Cycadopteris</i> described by Zigno are not convincing.
    There appear to be no satisfactory reasons for separating
    <i>Cycadopteris</i> from <i>Lomatopteris</i>, nor do the fronds described
    under these names exhibit any important differences from
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Ptilozamites">Ptilozamites.</h4>

  <p>Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> founded this genus on a remarkable series of
    specimens from the Rhaetic Coal-beds of Scania and assigned
    it to the Cycadophyta. The species <i>Ptilozamites Heeri</i> may be
    taken as a representative type. The leaves are linear and
    simply pinnate. In the example shown on a much reduced
    scale in <a href="#fig361">fig. 361</a> the frond is 53 cm. long and 2·1 cm. broad.
    The upper edge of each pinnule is straight or slightly concave;
    the lower edge is rounded; the veins are slightly divergent
    and dichotomously branched (<a href="#fig356">fig. 356</a>, E, p. 539). In some of
    Nathorst’s specimens the broad rachis is forked as in many
    Thinnfeldias.</p>

  <p>As a comparison of <a href="#fig356">fig. 356</a>, A and E, shows, the pinnules
    of some specimens of <i>Thinnfeldia odontopteroides</i> are identical
    with those of <i>Ptilozamites</i>. In the latter genus the rachis is
    either unbranched or occasionally forked, while in <i>Thinnfeldia</i>
    the branching may be of the dichotomous or pinnate type. In
    <i>Ptilozamites</i> the segments appear to be always without a midrib,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
    while a median vein frequently occurs in those of <i>Thinnfeldia</i>.
    There can be little doubt as to the very close alliance
    between the Rhaetic species referred to these two genera. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
    name <i>Ptilozamites</i> should perhaps be retained for such long
    and narrow fronds as that shown in <a href="#fig361">fig. 361</a>: no species
    included in <i>Thinnfeldia</i> is known in which the rachis reached
    so great a length without branching. The habit of <i>Ptilozamites
    Heeri</i> predisposes one in favour of Nathorst’s opinion
    that the fronds are Cycadean: we have no information in regard
    to the nature of the reproductive organs.</p>

  <h4 id="Ctenopteris">Ctenopteris.</h4>

  <p>This name was instituted by Saporta<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>, at Brongniart’s
    suggestion, for Liassic species characterised by pinnules like
    those of <i>Thinnfeldia</i>, but distinguished by the bipinnate habit
    of the frond. Saporta compares the genus with the Palaeozoic
    leaves known as <i>Odontopteris</i>, and with Italian Jurassic plants
    referred by Zigno to his genus <i>Dichopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Ctenozamites</i> is applied by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> to the type
    of frond which Saporta, Zeiller, and other authors refer to
    <i>Ctenopteris</i>. Nathorst instituted <i>Ctenozamites</i> for fossils agreeing
    in the form and venation of the pinnules with his genus
    <i>Ptilizamites</i> but differing in being bipinnate and not pinnate.</p>

  <p>Fronds of <i>Ctenopteris</i> are characteristic of the Jurassic and
    Rhaetic series; they are known only in the sterile condition.
    As Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> says, <i>Ctenopteris</i> may be a member of the Cycadofilices,
    an extinct group founded on Palaeozoic plants combining
    Cycadean and Filicinean characters, and some of which
    are now known to be Pteridosperms. It is probable that the
    genus is not a true fern: it is more likely to be a member
    of the Cycadophyta or of some generalised extinct group.</p>

    <p>Frond bipinnate, broad rachis giving off branches at an acute angle;

  </blockquote>

  <p>A frond very similar to the Lower Lias specimen from
    Dorsetshire represented in <a href="#fig362">fig. 362</a> was described by Leckenby
    as <i>Ctenis Leckenbyi</i> (Bean MS.) from the Inferior Oolite of
    Yorkshire<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>. Leckenby recognised the possibility of a Cycadean
    affinity, but regarded the bipinnate habit as an objection. The
    branched fronds of the Australian Cycad <i>Bowenia</i> supply an
    answer to this objection. Several good examples of <i>Ctenopteris
    cycadea</i> are figured by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> from Rhaetic rocks of Persia.
    Zeiller’s Tonkin Rhaetic species, <i>C. Sarrani</i><a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a>, affords a striking
    illustration of the difficulty of drawing a clear line of separation
    between <i>Ctenopteris</i> and some species of <i>Thinnfeldia</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Dichopteris">Dichopteris.</h4>

  <p>This genus was proposed by Zigno<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> for some large specimens
    from the Jurassic plant-beds of Northern Italy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The bipinnate leaves are characterised by the great breadth of the
      rachis which is dichotomously branched in the distal region (<a href="#fig363">fig. 363</a>); the
      linear pinnae reach a considerable length. Pinnules relatively small,
      oblong and slightly contracted at the base; the decurrent and confluent
      lamina forms a narrow wing to the main axis. Veins slightly divergent
      and forked, as in <i>Ptilozamites</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h6><i>Dichopteris visianica</i>, Zigno. Fig. 363.</h6>

  <p>A specimen of this species in the Padua Museum has a
    total length of 83 cm. It has been elsewhere suggested<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> that
    a fragment figured by Zigno as a fertile example of this type is
    probably part of a frond of the Osmundaceous fern <i>Todites</i>.
    Since this opinion was expressed I have had an opportunity
    of examining the actual specimen at Padua: the circular
    patches described by Zigno as sori appear to be irregularities in
    the matrix and not an original feature.</p>

  <p>Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> instituted the genus <i>Pachypteris</i> for some
    imperfectly preserved English Jurassic fossils from Whitby,
    which he described as <i>P. lanceolata</i>. Specimens have since
    been described<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> from the Inferior Oolite rocks of the Yorkshire
    coast. Brongniart described the pinnules as being without
    veins or as possessing only a midrib. It is almost certain that
    the apparent absence of veins in most specimens<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> is due to the
    fleshy nature of the segments and that the species <i>P. lanceolata</i>
    should be transferred to <i>Dichopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>Krasser<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> has described a species from Cretaceous rocks of the
    island of Lesina, off the Dalmatian coast, as <i>Pachypteris dalmatica</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
    which is very similar in habit to the English specimens
    and to Zigno’s <i>Dichopteris visianica</i>. One of Krasser’s specimens
    is practically identical with <i>Dichopteris lanceolata</i> (Brongn.),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
    while in others the small pinnules are replaced in some of the
    pinnae by a continuous lamina with a few distal serrations.
    The latter form a link between the <i>Dichopteris</i> and <i>Thinnfeldia</i>
    type of segment. Krasser gives a full résumé of opinions
    expressed by other authors in regard to the position of <i>Pachypteris</i>
    (= <i>Dichopteris</i>) and decides in favour of a Cycadean
    alliance.</p>

  <p>A French Jurassic plant which Saporta<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> made the type of a
    new genus <i>Scleropteris</i>, and described as <i>S. Pomelii</i>, appears
    to be indistinguishable from <i>Dichopteris</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Dichopteris</i>, though conveniently retained as a distinct
    genus, agrees so closely, in the broad and forked rachis and in
    the fleshy pinnules, with <i>Thinnfeldia</i> that it would seem reasonable
    to regard the two genera as members of the same group.</p>

  <p>Several authors have drawn attention to the striking
    resemblance in form and venation between the fronds of the
    Palaeozoic genus <i>Odontopteris</i> and those of <i>Ctenopteris</i> and
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i>. In <i>Odontopteris</i>, as in <i>Neuropteris</i>, another Palaeozoic
    genus, the rachis occasionally bifurcates as in <i>Thinnfeldia</i>
    and <i>Dichopteris</i>, and the ultimate segments of some species of
    <i>Odontopteris</i> (<a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a>, A) are practically identical with those of
    <i>Thinnfeldia</i> and <i>Ptilozamites</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Odontopteris</i> is probably a Pteridosperm. There is no
    adequate reason for supposing that this group of plants which
    played a prominent part in the Permo-Carboniferous floras was
    no longer in existence during the Mesozoic era.</p>

  <h4 id="Odontopteris">Odontopteris.</h4>

  <p>Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> instituted the genus <i>Odontopteris</i> for compound
    fronds from the Coal-Measures characterised by pinnules attached
    by the whole breadth of the base and traversed by
    numerous forked veins. <i>Odontopteris</i> is very rare in British
    Carboniferous rocks and “appears to be restricted to the Middle
    and Upper Coal-Measures<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds large, bipinnate or tripinnate, the main rachis, which may be
      dichotomously branched, bears long linear pinnae with broadly linear or
      deltoid pinnules, acute or blunt, attached by the whole of the base; the
      lower margin of the lamina, which is usually entire and rarely lobed (e.g.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span><i>Odontopteris osmundaeformis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>, is often decurrent on the axis of the pinna.
      The basal pinnule of each pinna is frequently attached by a contracted
      base, and the lamina may differ in form from that of the normal segments.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>Pinnules often occur on the main rachis, and in some species the petiole
      bears modified pinnules which are larger than the ultimate segments of
      the pinnae and in some cases Cyclopteroid in shape. The pinnules are
      traversed by numerous dichotomously branched veins; if a midrib is
      present it dies out in the basal part of the lamina. In some species
      (genus <i>Mixoneura</i>) pinnules of the Neuropteroid type, characterised by a
      well-defined midrib, occur in association with typical Odontopteroid
      pinnules on the same pinna.</p>

  <p>The species represented in <a href="#fig364">fig. 364</a>, C, D, from the Middle
    Coal-Measures of Barnsley, Yorkshire, illustrates the form and
    venation of the <i>Odontopteris</i> type of pinnule. Another species,
    <i>O. Reichiana</i> Gutb.<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>, is also recorded by Kidston from the Lower
    Coal-Measures of Lancashire. Some unusually good specimens
    of the type-species of the genus <i>Odontopteris minor</i>, Brongn.,
    have been figured by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> from the Coal-Measures of Blanzy
    (<a href="#fig365">fig. 365</a>) which show the dichotomy of the main axis and the
    occurrence of Aphlebiae on the petiole. The late Dr Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>
    divided <i>Odontopteris</i> into two sections, <i>Xenopteris</i> and <i>Mixoneura</i>,
    the pinnules of the former having the form shown in
    <a href="#fig364">fig. 364</a>, D; while in species of the latter sub-genus some of
    the pinnules are identical in form and venation with those of
    <i>Neuropteris</i> except that they are attached by the whole breadth
    of the base. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> employs <i>Mixoneura</i> as a generic designation.
    In an American species <i>O. Wortheni</i> Lesq.<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> the pinnules
    bear numerous hairs like those on some species of <i>Neuropteris</i>
    (<a href="#fig373">fig. 373</a>, p. 570). The large size of the fronds of <i>Odontopteris</i> suggested
    to Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> that they were borne on the stems of tree-ferns,
    but Grand’Eury’s<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> examination of specimens in the Coal-beds
    of central France led him to picture the plant as bearing a tuft
    of leaves on a short subterranean stem. Renault and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>,
    on the other hand, obtained evidence in the Commentry Coal-field
    of fronds borne on elongated stems which grew on the
    ground and were supported by stronger plants. Stur<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> was the
    first to suggest that <i>Odontopteris</i> should be excluded from the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>ferns. Grand’Eury’s<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> supposed fertile pinnules of <i>Odontopteris</i>
    do not afford any satisfactory evidence of the sporangial nature
    of the small swellings which he figures at the ends of the veins.
    This author pointed out several years ago that the petioles of
    some species of <i>Odontopteris</i> possess the anatomical features of
    <i>Myeloxylon</i>, a type of leaf-stalk which is now known to belong
    to Pteridosperms. In a recent paper Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> records the
    association of <i>Odontopteris</i> fronds with small seeds (<i>Odontopterocarpus</i>),
    a discovery which leaves little or no doubt as to the
    Pteridospermic nature of the genus. The fronds of <i>Odontopteris</i>
    are very similar in habit to those of <i>Neuropteris</i>, another
    Pteridospermic genus.</p>

  <p>The similarity between some <i>Odontopteris</i> and <i>Thinnfeldia</i>
    leaves, to which attention has already been called, is well illustrated
    by <i>O. genuina</i> Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>, a pinnule of which is represented
    in <a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a>, A. <i>Odontopteris</i> is a fairly widespread genus
    in Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian rocks, and is recorded
    also from Triassic strata: it is represented in the Coal-fields of
    North America and in several parts of Europe<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a>.</p>

  <p>In some fronds included in <i>Odontopteris</i> the pinnae are
    characterised by a broad irregularly lobed lamina which also
    forms a winged border to the rachis. Examples of this form are
    afforded by <i>Odontopteris Browni</i> Sew.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> from the Burghersdorp
    Series (Triassic?) of Cape Colony, and <i>O. Fischeri</i> described by
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> from the Permian of Russia. The Russian species
    would perhaps be more appropriately placed in the genus
    <i>Callipteris</i>, as Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> suggests; the absence of venation in
    <i>O. Browni</i> renders generic identification unsatisfactory.</p>

  <h4 id="Callipteris">Callipteris.</h4>

  <p>Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> instituted this genus for certain species of
    supposed ferns previously referred to the genera <i>Pecopteris</i>,
    <i>Alethopteris</i>, and <i>Neuropteris</i>. <i>Callipteris</i> is a characteristic
    Permian plant which is almost certainly a Pteridosperm.
    Zeiller has pointed out that such descriptions of fertile specimens
    as have been written are unsatisfactory. A few years ago, however,
    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> recorded the occurrence of seeds in association
    with Callipteris fronds in the Autun district, and in some cases
    they were found attached to the pinnae and rachis. The seeds
    are ovoid or spherical (5–10 mm. broad) and smaller than
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>those of <i>Neuropteris</i>. The drawings of fertile segments published
    by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> afford no indication of reproductive organs.
    Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> figures some pinnules of <i>Callipteris conferta</i> in which
    the thick lamina is covered with sinuous grooves probably
    made by some insect larvae: as he suggests, similar markings
    may have been mistaken for the remains of sori. The occurrence
    of <i>Callipteris</i> fronds recorded by Weber and Sterzel<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a>
    in association with <i>Medullosa</i> stems in the Lower Permian
    of Saxony is in accordance with Grand’Eury’s conclusion.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds reaching 1 metre in length, bipinnate or tripinnate, main
      rachis frequently exhibiting a combination of dichotomous and pinnate
      branching. Pinnae linear, usually crowded, decurrent on the rachis; the
      pinnules on the lower side of the pinnae are continued on to the rachis.
      Pinnules of the Pecopteroid type, entire or slightly lobed, or of the
      Sphenopteroid type and more or less deeply dissected (<a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a> C, D), the
      lamina of adjacent pinnules concrescent; on the lower pinnae the
      lamina may be continuous as in an Alethopteris pinnule. A midrib
      may extend almost to the bluntly rounded apex of the ultimate segments,
      giving off oblique, simple, or forked veins, the lowest of which arise directly
      from the rachis; in the Sphenopteroid forms the lateral veins are given
      off at a more acute angle.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A striking feature of the genus is the occurrence of pinnules
    on the main rachis, as in <i>Odontopteris</i>. Zeiller has wisely
    extended the application of <i>Callipteris</i> to fronds possessing this
    character irrespective of the entire or lobed form of the
    ultimate segments. He found among the numerous examples
    of the genus obtained from Autun<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> and Lodève<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> transitional
    forms connecting such species as <i>C. conferta</i> (<a href="#fig367">fig. 367</a>) and
    <i>C. Pellati</i> Zeill. (<a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a>, C) in which the Pecopteroid pinnules
    are slightly lobed, with <i>C. lyratifolia</i> (Goepp.) (<a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a>, D),
    <i>C. flabellifera</i><a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> (Weiss), and <i>C. Bergeroni</i> Zeill. characterised by
    deeply lobed Sphenopteroid segments.</p>

  <p>In a recent account of some Permian plants from Germany,
    Schuster<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> refers a portion of a frond to <i>Callipteris conferta</i>
    (Sternberg) var. <i>polymorpha</i> Sterzel, which is characterised by
    unusually large and polymorphic pinnules. In size and shape
    the pinnules recall those of <i>Neuropteridium validum</i> Feist.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span></p>

  <h4 id="Callipteridium">Callipteridium.</h4>

  <p>The name <i>Callipteridium</i>, created by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> as a sub-genus
    of <i>Odontopteris</i>, is applied by Zeiller and other authors to a
    few Upper Carboniferous and Permian species characterised by
    the occurrence of simply pinnate pinnae on the main rachis
    between the bipinnate primary pinnae. Single pinnules are
    borne directly on the rachis of the primary pinnae between the
    pinnate branches. The form and venation of a typical pinnule
    are shown in <a href="#fig366">fig. 366</a>, B. <i>Callipteridium pteridium</i>, originally
    recorded by Schlotheim as <i>Filicites pteridius</i><a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>, has been fully
    described by Renault and Zeiller from unusually large specimens
    found in the Commentry Coal-field<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>. This species illustrates
    the peculiar morphological features of the genus. The main
    rachis of the tripinnate fronds, several metres long, shows a
    combination of dichotomous and pinnate branching; from the
    zigzag and forked axis are given off bipinnate pinnae and,
    between these, shorter pinnate branches. The pinnules closely
    resemble those of <i>Callipteris conferta</i> but reach a greater length;
    the pinnules borne on the rachises of the lateral branches differ
    from the others in their broader base and more triangular lamina.</p>

  <p>No fertile specimens have been found. It is probable that
    <i>Callipteridium</i> was not a true fern, and that White<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> is correct
    in including it among the Pteridosperms.</p>

  <h4 id="Archaeopteris">Archaeopteris.</h4>

  <p>In 1852 Forbes<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> published a brief description of some

    Ireland in Upper Devonian rocks of Kilkenny, under the name
    <i>Cyclopteris hibernica</i>. The Irish specimens were more fully
    described by Baily<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> in 1858. Fronds of the same type were
    referred by other authors to <i>Cyclopteris</i>, <i>Adiantites</i> or <i>Noeggerathia</i>,
    until Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> proposed the generic name <i>Palaeopteris</i>
    on the ground that the fronds described by Forbes and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>Baily are distinguished by the nature of their fertile pinnae
    from the sterile leaves included in Brongniart’s provisional
    genus <i>Cyclopteris</i>. The earlier use of <i>Palaeopteris</i> by Geinitz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
    for an entirely different plant led Dawson<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> to institute the
    genus <i>Archaeopteris</i>. The genus <i>Archaeopteris</i> may be defined
    as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds bipinnate, reaching a considerable length (90 cm.); the stout
      rachis bears long linear pinnae; sterile pinnules obovate or cuneate with
      an entire, lobed, fimbriate, or laciniate lamina traversed by divergent
      dichotomously branched veins. The fertile pinnae usually occur on the
      lower part of the rachis; pinnules with a much reduced lamina bear
      numerous fusiform or oval exannulate sporangia (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, A, E, H), sessile
      or shortly stalked, singly, or in groups of two or three. The base of the
      petiole is characterised by a pair of partially adnate stipules (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, C, D),
      and single pinnules or scales occur in some species on the rachis between
      the pinnae and on the petiole.</p>

  <h6><i>Archaeopteris hibernica</i> (Forbes). Figs. <a href="#fig368">368</a>, <a href="#fig369">369</a>, A–C.</h6>

  <p>The specimen from Kilkenny represented in <a href="#fig368">fig. 368</a> has
    a length of over 80 cm. The upper pinnae bear numerous
    imbricate obovate pinnules (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, A, B) with an entire or
    very slightly fimbriate margin, while on the shorter lower
    pinnae the ultimate segments are reduced to a slender axis
    bearing numerous fusiform sporangia, 2–3 mm. in length.
    Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> has pointed out that sporangia occasionally occur
    on the edge of ordinary pinnules, and he first recognised the
    stipular nature of the scale-like appendages which Baily noticed
    on the swollen petiole base (5 cm. broad) of the Irish species
    (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, C). Restorations of <i>Archaeopteris hibernica</i> have been
    figured by Baily<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> and by Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>, but the description of
    the fertile pinnae by the latter author requires modification in
    the light of Kidston’s description of the Dublin specimens.</p>

  <p><i>Archaeopteris</i> is recorded from Upper Devonian rocks of the
    South of Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Southern Russia, Bear
    Island, and Ellesmere Land in the Arctic regions, Canada,
    Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Many of the specimens described
    under different names bear a close resemblance, which in some
    cases probably amounts to specific identity, to <i>A. hibernica</i>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span><i>A. Jacksoni</i> originally described by Dawson<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> and more recently
    by Smith and White<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> from Devonian rocks of Maine, the
    Canadian type <i>A. gaspiensis</i> Daws., and some species figured
    by Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> from Pennsylvania, are examples of forms
    which present a striking similarity in habit to the Irish species.
    The Belgian Devonian fossils named by Crépin<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> <i>Palaeopteris
    hibernica</i> var. <i>minor</i> are regarded by him as probably identical
    with Goeppert’s species <i>Cyclopteris Roemeriana</i> from the neighbourhood
    of Aachen. Heer recorded <i>Archaeopteris Roemeriana</i>
    from Upper Devonian beds in Bear Island, and Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>, who
    has published a more complete account of the Arctic forms,
    draws attention to the resemblance of some of them to
    <i>A. hibernica</i>. A species described by Schmalhausen<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> from
    the Upper Devonian of Southern Russia as <i>A. archetypus</i>
    (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, D) appears to differ from <i>A. hibernica</i> in the slightly
    less reduced lamina of the fertile segments. This species has
    been more adequately illustrated by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> from material
    collected in Ellesmere Land: he is unable to confirm Schmalhausen’s
    statement that the pinnae are spirally disposed.</p>

  <p>The species <i>A. fimbriata</i> (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, G) described by Nathorst
    from Bear Island is characterised by the more deeply dissected
    lamina of the sterile pinnules. In <i>A. fissilis</i> Schmal. from
    Russia and Ellesmere Land the lamina (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, E, F) is cut
    up into filiform segments: a fertile pinnule of this species
    is represented in <a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>, E.</p>

  <p>Some sterile impressions figured by Krasser<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> from Palaeozoic
    strata (Lower Carboniferous or Upper Devonian?) in the
    province of Nanshan in China as <i>Noeggerathia acuminifissa</i>
    are considered by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> to be portions of an <i>Archaeopteris</i>
    or <i>Rhacopteris</i> frond. The resemblance to the former genus
    is however by no means close enough to warrant a reference
    to <i>Archaeopteris</i>. The sterile specimens described by Stur<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>
    from the Culm of Altendorf as species of <i>Archaeopteris</i> are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>probably not generically identical with the Irish and Arctic
    species. The dichotomous branching of the rachis in <i>A. Tschermaki</i>
    and <i>A. Dawsoni</i> is a feature unknown in <i>Archaeopteris</i>.
    In the absence of fertile pinnae the separation of <i>Archaeopteris</i>
    from <i>Rhacopteris</i> is by no means easy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span></p>

  <p><i>Archaeopteris</i> was regarded by Carruthers as a fern closely
    allied to recent species of Hymenophyllaceae, but this conclusion
    was based upon an interpretation of the fertile segments
    which Kidston<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> has shown to be incorrect. The latter author
    regarded the presence of stipules and the structure of the
    exannulate sporangia as evidence of a Marattiaceous alliance.
    In a later reference to <i>Archaeopteris</i>, Kidston expresses the
    opinion that the genus is not a true fern but a member of the
    Cycadofilices or Pteridosperms, a view shared by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a>
    and doubtless by many other palaeobotanists. The sporangia
    of <i>Archaeopteris</i> appear to be of the same type as those of
    <i>Dactylotheca</i> (<a href="#fig290">fig. 290</a>, E, p. 399). Schmalhausen gave expression
    to his disagreement with Nathorst and other authors who
    referred <i>Archaeopteris</i> to the Marattiaceae by proposing the
    distinctive group-name Archaeopterideae.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the reproductive organs of
    <i>Archaeopteris</i> so far discovered are microsporangia, and that the
    plant bore seeds. The sporangia are larger than those of any
    known fern and, as Kidston points out, they are similar to those
    of <i>Crossotheca</i> which he has shown to be microsporangia of the
    Pteridosperm <i>Lyginodendron</i>. The presence of stipules in
    <i>Archaeopteris hibernica</i>, <i>A. fimbriata</i>, <i>A. archetypus</i> (<a href="#fig369">fig. 369</a>,
    D) and probably throughout the genus does not materially
    affect the question of taxonomic position. Stipules are a
    characteristic feature of Marattiaceae and, in a reduced form,
    of Osmundaceae, but similar appendages are borne at the base
    of the petiole of the Cycad <i>Ceratozamia</i>. The occurrence of
    Aphlebiae on the rachis of <i>Archaeopteris</i> is a feature shared by
    the fronds of <i>Neuropteris</i> and other Pteridosperms.</p>

  <h4 id="Neuropteris">Neuropteris.</h4>

  <p>The fronds for which Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> created this genus,
    though suspected by Stur in 1883 as wrongly classed among
    the ferns, have only recently been shown to be the leaves of
    Pteridosperms. As yet only one case is recorded in which</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

  <p><i>Neuropteris</i> pinnae occur in organic connexion with seeds<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>,
    but it is almost certain that the genus as a whole must be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>placed in this generalised group. Renault<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> pointed out that
    the petioles of Neuropteris fronds from Autun had the anatomical
    features of <i>Myeloxylon</i> (petiole of <i>Medullosa</i>). Since Kidston’s
    important discovery of seed-bearing pinnae of <i>N. heterophylla</i>,
    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> has recorded the association of Neuropteris fronds
    with seeds in French Coal-fields. By some of the older authors
    <i>Neuropteris</i> was compared with <i>Osmunda</i> because of a similarity
    in venation. In the frequent dichotomy of the frond and
    in the occurrence of pinnules on the rachis, <i>Neuropteris</i> closely
    resembles <i>Odontopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a>: there can be little doubt as to the
    close relationship of the Pteridosperms possessing these two
    types of foliage. <i>Neuropteris</i> may be defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds reaching a considerable size, probably in soma cases a length of
      10 metres<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a>; bi- or tri-pinnate; the rachis may be dichotomously branched
      (figs. <a href="#fig354">354</a>, D; <a href="#fig370">370</a>); both rachis and petiole bear single pinnules, those on
      the latter frequently differ from the normal leaflets in their larger Cyclopteroid
      laminae (<a href="#fig370">fig. 370</a>). Pinnules entire, rarely slightly lobed, broadly
      linear, attached by a small portion of the base, which is usually more
      or less cordate. In <i>N. Grangeri</i> Brongn. the pinnules are attached by
      a short pedicel<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a>. The midrib always dies out before reaching the blunt or
      pointed apex of the lamina and gives off at an acute angle numerous
      secondary veins characterised by their arched course and repeated forking.</p>

  <p>Potonié describes the secondary veins of the pinnules of
    <i>Neuropteris pseudogigantea</i><a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> as occasionally anastomosing, a
    feature which may be regarded as a step towards the reticulate
    venation of the closely allied genus <i>Linopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> described some petrified pinnules of <i>Neuropteris</i>
    in which the mesophyll shows a differentiation into upper
    palisade tissue and lacunar tissue below; the lower epidermis is
    infolded at intervals where grooves (probably stomatal) occur
    like those on the leaves of an Oleander (<i>Nerium oleander</i>).</p>

  <p>The rachises of Neuropteris fronds are described by Grand’Eury
    under the generic name <i>Aulacopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a>.</p>

  <p>This species is characteristic of the Lower Coal-Measures
    of Britain; it occurs also in the Middle Coal-Measures and is
    a common type in Upper Carboniferous rocks in various parts
    of the world. The fronds are large and tripinnate, the rachis
    is often dichotomously branched and Cyclopteroid pinnules
    may occur on the petiole. The pinnules, 5–20 mm. in length
    and 3–8 mm. broad, have a rounded apex (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, E, p. 535).</p>

  <p>The rachis of the large fronds of this species illustrates the
    dichotomous habit of many Neuropteris fronds, also the occurrence
    on the petiole of large Cyclopteroid pinnules (cf. <a href="#fig370">fig. 370</a>).
    The small piece of a pinna reproduced in <a href="#fig372">fig. 372</a> shows the
    slender attachment of the segments, the blunt apex, and the
    Neuropteroid venation. Single pinnules of this species may be
    distinguished from those of <i>N. Scheuchzeri</i> by the blunter apex,
    the absence of the pair of small Cyclopteroid pinnules on the
    same branch and by the absence of hairs. <i>N. macrophylla</i> is
    characteristic of the Upper Coal-Measures of Britain.</p>

  <p>Fragments of this well-known Coal-Measure species were
    figured by Scheuchzer in his <i>Herbarium Diluvianum</i><a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> as <i>Lithosmunda
    minor</i>, and by Lhywd (Luidius<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a>) as <i>Phyllites mineralis</i> as
    early as 1760. <i>Neuropteris Scheuchzeri</i>, so named by Hoffmann
    in 1826, is a type which many authors have described under
    different names. Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> figured it as <i>N. hirsuta</i> from the
    Coal-fields of Pennsylvania, and under the same name it is
    recorded by Fontaine and White<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> from Permian rocks of
    Virginia. The oval patches on the surface of a pinnule described
    by these authors as sori are certainly not of that nature.
    The same species is described by Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> from Nova Scotia
    as <i>N. cordata</i> Brongn. var. <i>angustifolia</i>. For a full synonymy

  <p>The large tripinnate fronds are characterised by the long
    linear- or oval-lanceolate pinnules (<a href="#fig373">fig. 373</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> with a pointed
    apex and numerous bristle-like hairs on the lamina; two much
    smaller Cyclopteroid segments occur at the base of the pinnae
    which are terminated by the linear leaflets (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, F, p. 535).</p>

  <p><i>Neuropteris Scheuchzeri</i> is characteristic of the Upper and
    Middle Coal-Measures of Britain and is recorded from several
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>localities in North America and the Continent. Zalessky<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> has
    recently recorded the species from the Coal-Measures of Donetz.
    The frequent occurrence of detached pinnules points to a
    caducous habit. Even single leaflets can, however, be identified
    by their large size, the pointed apex, and hairy lamina. The
    hairs are preserved as fine oblique lines simulating veins;
    they were so described by Roemer<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> who took them for cross-connexions
    between the secondary veins and referred the pinnules
    to Gutbier’s genus <i>Dictyopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>Another example of <i>Neuropteris</i> with hairy pinnules is
    described from the Commentry Coal-field by Renault and
    Zeiller as <i>N. horrida</i><a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a>. The oval-linear, bluntly rounded,
    pinnules are characterised by a median band of hairs on each
    surface and a narrower strip at the edge of the lamina.</p>

  <h4 id="Cyclopteris">Cyclopteris.</h4>

  <p>This generic name was created by Brongniart in 1828<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> for
    specimens which he believed to be complete single leaves of
    orbicular or reniform shape similar to those of <i>Trichomanes
    reniforme</i>. The lamina is traversed by numerous dichotomously
    branched veins which spread from the centre of the base.</p>

  <p>It was suspected by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> that certain
    Cyclopteris leaves belonged to the frond of a species of
    <i>Neuropteris</i>, and some years later Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> concluded that
    Brongniart’s genus was founded on orbicular leaflets of <i>Neuropteris</i>.
    In 1869 Roehl<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> figured a specimen of <i>Neuropteris</i>
    bearing Cyclopteroid pinnules on its rachis. It is now universally
    admitted that <i>Cyclopteris</i> is not a distinct genus and that
    the specimens so named were borne as modified pinnules on the
    main rachis of <i>Neuropteris</i> and <i>Odontopteris</i>. It is, however,
    convenient to retain the name for detached leaflets which
    cannot be referred to the fronds on which they were borne. A
    specimen found by Mr Hemingway in the Upper Coal-Measures
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>of Yorkshire and described in 1888<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> affords a striking example
    of the large size attained by what was probably a frond of
    <i>Neuropteris</i>. The piece of main rachis reached a length of
    over 120 cm. and bore five pairs of Cyclopteris pinnules, some
    of which were 7 cm. long and 5 cm. broad. The complete
    frond must have reached a length of at least 4 metres. Fig. 370
    shows some typical Cyclopteroid leaflets on the petiole of a
    <i>Neuropteris</i> frond.</p>

  <p>The Upper Palaeozoic fronds included in this genus are
    more familiar as species of <i>Dictyopteris</i>. Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> has, however,
    pointed out that the creation of this name by Lamouroux in
    1809 for a genus of Brown Algae which is still retained, makes
    it advisable to fall back upon the designation <i>Linopteris</i>.
    Gutbier<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> proposed the genus <i>Dictyopteris</i> in 1835: <i>Linopteris</i>
    was first used by Presl<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> in 1838. The fronds so named are
    identical with species of <i>Neuropteris</i> except in the anastomosis
    of the secondary veins; <i>Linopteris</i> bears to <i>Neuropteris</i> the
    same relation as <i>Lonchopteris</i> bears to <i>Alethopteris</i>. As in
    <i>Neuropteris</i>, Cyclopteroid pinnules occur on the petioles of <i>Linopteris</i>,
    but the veins form a fine reticulum. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> records
    the association of <i>Linopteris Brongniarti</i> with seeds belonging
    to the genus <i>Hexagonocarpon</i>, a fact which points to the
    Pteridosperm nature of the foliage.</p>

  <p>Some fertile pinnules of <i>Linopteris Schutzei</i> (Roemer) are
    described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> from Autun as bearing on the under
    surface of the lamina two rows of long and pointed sporangia,
    probably united in groups. The presumption is that these are
    microsporangia.</p>

  <p>Fig. 374 is a reproduction of a careful drawing, originally
    published by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a>, of a pinnule of the type-specimen of
    Gutbier’s species <i>Linopteris neuropteroides</i>. This species differs
    from <i>Linopteris obliqua</i>, instituted by Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> for specimens
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>obtained by Lyell<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> from the Coal-Measures of Nova Scotia, in
    the smaller size of the meshes. <i>Linopteris obliqua</i> occurs in the
    Upper and Middle Coal-Measures of Britain; it is recorded by
    Zeiller from Asia Minor, by Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> from Pennsylvania,
    and by other authors from several European localities. The
    pinnules frequently occur detached from the frond and like
    those of some species of <i>Neuropteris</i> were caducous. <i>Linopteris</i>
    is rare in British strata.</p>

  <h4 id="Alethopteris">Alethopteris.</h4>

  <p>The name <i>Alethopteris</i>, instituted by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a>, is applied
    to compound fronds often reaching a considerable size, exhibiting
    the following features:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The linear pinnules are attached by the whole breadth of the base,
      with the lower edge of the lamina decurrent and usually continuous with
      that of the next pinnule (figs. <a href="#fig290">290</a>, A, p. <a href="#Page_399">399</a>; <a href="#Page_375">375</a>). The ultimate segments
      are entire, with an acute or rounded apex and often characterised by a fairly
      thick lamina convex on the upper surface. From a prominent midrib,
      continued to the apex of the pinnule, numerous simple and forked secondary
      veins are given off at a wide angle, the decurrent portion of the lamina
      being supplied by veins direct from the axis of the pinna. In the upper
      part of a frond or primary pinna the pinnules may be replaced by a
      continuous, lobed, or entire simple lamina. The main rachis occasionally
      exhibits dichotomous branching, but the fronds are for the most part
      constructed on the pinnate plan. Single Cyclopteroid pinnules<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a> occur on
      the petiole of some species of the genus.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span></p>

  <p>In certain species of <i>Alethopteris</i> the pinnules appear to
    have been deciduous as in <i>Didymochlaena</i> among recent ferns<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a>.
    A piece of cuticle from the upper surface of a pinnule of
    <i>Alethopteris Grandini</i> (Brongn.) figured by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> shows very
    clearly the polygonal form and straight walls of most of the
    epidermal cells, those above the veins being almost rectangular.
    The position of the sunken stomata is revealed by small circular
    spaces surrounded by a circle of cells.</p>

  <p>The absence of fertile specimens of this common genus of
    Upper Carboniferous plants led Stur<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> to exclude it from the
    ferns. Although no seeds have so far been found in organic
    connexion with an Alethopteris frond, it is certain that some
    species, probably all, represent the foliage of Pteridosperms.
    Renault was the first to describe petrified specimens of <i>Alethopteris</i>
    fronds exhibiting the anatomical structure of <i>Myeloxylon</i>
    (leaf-axis of <i>Medullosa</i>). The calcareous nodules from English
    Coal-seams contain numerous fragments of the Myeloxylon
    type of rachis bearing Alethopteroid pinnules.</p>

  <p>The constant association of the fronds of <i>Alethopteris
    lonchitica</i> and <i>Trigonocarpon</i> seeds noticed by Mr Hemingway
    in the Coal-Measures of Yorkshire led him to regard the species
    as seed-bearing: it has since been recognised as the foliage of
    the Pteridosperm <i>Medullosa anglica</i><a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a>.</p>

  <p>Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> has recorded the association in French Coal-fields
    of species of <i>Alethopteris</i> with <i>Trigonocarpon</i> and <i>Pachytesta</i>
    seeds.</p>

  <h6><i>Alethopteris lonchitica</i> (Schlotheim)<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a>. Figs. <a href="#fig364">364</a>, A; <a href="#fig290">290</a>, A.</h6>

  <p>This species, described by Schlotheim in 1820 as <i>Filicites
    lonchiticus</i> and previously figured by Scheuchzer<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a>, is abundant
    in the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a>. It is
    characterised by large tripinnate fronds, probably quadripinnate
    in the lower part, bearing primary pinnae of a more or less
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>triangular form divided into pinnate branches replaced in the
    apical region by linear segments. The pinnules, 8–30 mm. long
    and 3–5 broad, are linear- or oval-lanceolate with an obtuse
    apex; the upper margin of the lamina is slightly contracted at
    the base, while the lower edge is decurrent.</p>

  <h6><i>Alethopteris Serlii</i> (Brongniart)<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a>. Fig. 375.</h6>

  <p>This species, figured by Parkinson in 1811, closely resembles
    <i>A. lonchitica</i>, but is distinguished by the more crowded
    and relatively longer pinnules which are joined to one another
    by a narrow connecting lamina (Fig. 375). The secondary
    veins in <i>A. Serlii</i> are rather finer and more numerous. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a>
    records the association of the seed <i>Pachytesta</i> with fronds
    of this species in the Coal-Measures of St Étienne.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span></p>

  <p><i>A. Serlii</i> is very abundant in the Upper Coal-Measures but
    rare in the Middle Coal-Measures of Britain<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Lonchopteris">Lonchopteris.</h4>

  <p>This name was proposed by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> for sterile fronds
    from Upper Carboniferous rocks which are practically identical
    with species of <i>Alethopteris</i>, but differ in the reticulate venation
    of the pinnules. It has been pointed out in a previous chapter<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a>
    that <i>Lonchopteris</i> is usually used for Palaeozoic species, the
    Wealden leaves, which were placed in this genus by Brongniart,
    being transferred to <i>Weichselia</i>.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt as to the close relationship of
    <i>Lonchopteris</i> with <i>Alethopteris</i>: both may be referred to the
    Pteridosperms. <i>Lonchopteris rugosa</i> Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> (<a href="#fig290">fig. 290</a>, B, p. 399)
    and <i>L. Bricei</i> Brongn., both British species, are fairly common
    in Upper Carboniferous strata. In <i>L. rugosa</i>, a Middle Coal-Measures
    species, the anastomosing secondary veins form polygonal
    meshes (<a href="#fig290">fig. 290</a>, B, p. 399) smaller than those of <i>L. Bricei</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Pecopteris">Pecopteris.</h4>

  <p>Reference has already been made to this genus in the
    chapter on Marattiales, so far as regards certain species of
    fertile fronds the sporangia of which resemble those of recent
    Marattiaceae. It is, however, by no means safe to assume that
    such Pecopteris fronds were borne on stems having the anatomical
    characters of ferns. The sporangia in some at least of the
    species may have contained microspores. In one Upper Carboniferous
    species usually referred to Pecopteris, <i>P. Pluckeneti</i>,
    Schlot., Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> has recorded the occurrence of seeds on
    the pinnules of the ordinary fronds. This species will be
    referred to in Volume <span class="allsmcap">III</span>. The substitution of such generic
    names as <i>Ptychocarpus</i>, <i>Asterotheca</i>, <i>Hawlea</i>, <i>Dactylotheca</i>
    and others for the purely provisional designation <i>Pecopteris</i>
    indicates a step towards a conclusion as to natural affinity.
    The probability is that <i>Pecopteris</i>, as applied to Palaeozoic
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>species, in many cases stands for the compound fronds of
    true ferns, but the possibility of the inclusion of those of
    Pteridosperms in the same category is by no means excluded.
    The designation <i>Pecopteris</i> may conveniently be retained for
    sterile bipinnate, tripinnate, or quadripinnate fronds bearing
    pinnules having the following characteristics:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Lamina short, attached to the rachis by the whole of the base and at a
      wide angle, with the edges parallel or slightly converging towards the
      usually blunt apex; adjacent pinnules may be continuous basally by a
      narrow lamina. A well-marked midrib extends to the apex and gives off
      simple or forked lateral veins almost at right angles (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, D, p. 529).</p>

    <p>Hydathodes like those on the leaflets of <i>Polypodium vulgare</i> and other
      recent ferns<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> are occasionally seen at the ends of the lateral veins of
      Pecopteris pinnules.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In addition to the examples of Palaeozoic fronds with
    the <i>Pecopteris</i> form of pinnule referred to in chapter <span class="allsmcap">XXII.</span>, the
    species <i>Pecopteris arborescens</i> may be briefly described.</p>

  <h6><i>Pecopteris arborescens</i> (Schlotheim)<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a>. Figs. <a href="#fig352">352</a>, D: <a href="#fig376">376</a>.</h6>

  <p>The species named by Schlotheim <i>Filicites arborescens</i> in
    1804 is characteristic of the Upper Coal-Measures and is
    recorded also from Permian strata<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fronds large; the rachis, which may reach a breadth of 3 cm.<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a>, gives off
      long ovoid-lanceolate pinnae in two alternate rows (<a href="#fig376">fig. 376</a>); pinnules
      small, 1·5–4mm. long and 1–2mm. broad, contiguous, with rounded
      apex, attached approximately at right angles; the upper surface of the
      lamina is slightly convex and may be hairy<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a>. The fertile pinnules,
      identical in shape with the sterile, bear groups of ovoid exannulate
      sporangia (synangia). The midrib extends to the apex of the pinnule and
      gives off simple veins at a wide angle (<a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, D).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Our knowledge of the reproductive organs is very meagre.
    Grand’Eury described the synangia as consisting of 3–5
    sporangia borne on a central receptacle; sporangia have been
    described also by Stur<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>, Renault and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a>, and Potonié<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>but no fertile British specimens are recorded. Stur places this
    species in the genus <i>Scolecopteris</i>, and Potonié regards the
    sporangia found by him on Permian fronds, which may be
    identical with <i>Pecopteris arborescens</i>, as conforming to those of
    the <i>Asterotheca</i> type. It is impossible to decide on the evidence
    available whether this species is a Pteridosperm or a
    fern, but there is a natural inclination in doubtful cases to give
    preference to the first of these two choices.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The numerous fronds from Carboniferous and Permian rocks
    described as species of <i>Pecopteris</i> exhibit a considerable range
    of variation in the form of the pinnules. In many species the
    pinnules are of the type represented in <a href="#fig352">fig. 352</a>, D; in others
    the lamina of the ultimate segments is slightly contracted at
    the base and the secondary veins are given off at a more acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
    angle, as in <i>Pecopteris polymorpha</i>, Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> In <i>Pecopteris
    unita</i>, Brongn., already described as <i>Ptychocarpus unita</i><a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a>, the
    pinnules are joined together except in the apical region. Some
    fronds included in <i>Pecopteris</i> possess pinnules in which Pecopteroid
    and Sphenopteroid features are combined; <i>P. Sterzeli</i>,
    Zeill.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> and <i>P. Pluckeneti</i>, Schlot. are examples of fronds in
    which the pinnules are lobed as in <i>Sphenopteris</i>, but the base
    of the lamina is only slightly contracted and the venation is not
    that of typical Sphenopteris species.</p>

  <p>The species to which Potonié has applied the generic name
    <i>Alloiopteris</i><a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> also illustrates the impossibility of drawing a
    sharp line between <i>Pecopteris</i> and <i>Sphenopteris</i>. The fronds
    already described in chapter <span class="allsmcap">XXV.</span> under the designation
    <i>Corynepteris</i> bear pinnules with a contracted base; in some
    species the lamina is lobed, but in others (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, G) it is
    entire with a midrib nearer one edge than the other. The
    species which Potonié assigns to <i>Alloiopteris</i>, like many other
    Sphenopteroid and Pecopteroid fronds, are characterised by
    the occurrence of an abnormal pinnule (aphlebia) at the base
    of each pinna (<a href="#fig354">fig. 354</a>, G, p. 535). Young fronds of <i>Pecopteris</i>
    are occasionally met with showing very clearly the circinate
    vernation of the pinnae as in the leaves of <i>Cycas</i> and <i>Angiopteris</i>
    represented in <a href="#fig220">fig. 220</a>, p. 283. The genus <i>Spiropteris</i> was created
    by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> for coiled unexpanded fronds of fossil ferns; it is
    however superfluous to apply a distinctive term to specimens
    of this kind.</p>

  <p>The designation <i>Pecopteris</i> is employed chiefly for leaves
    of Palaeozoic age which are unknown in the fertile state, or do
    not afford sufficient evidence as to the nature of the sporangia
    to justify the substitution of a special generic name. Many
    Mesozoic species have also been referred to <i>Pecopteris</i>, but most
    of these are more appropriately included in Brongniart’s later
    genus <i>Cladophlebis</i>. The pinnules of <i>Cladophlebis</i>, as Brongniart
    pointed out, are intermediate between <i>Pecopteris</i> and <i>Neuropteris</i>;
    they are usually attached by the whole breadth of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>the base, as in <i>Pecopteris</i>, but the more acute origin, more
    arched form, and more frequent dichotomy of the lateral veins
    are features shared by <i>Neuropteris</i>. As a rule, Mesozoic sterile
    fronds with straight or folded, entire or dentate pinnules are
    of the Cladophlebis type: this genus is especially characteristic
    of Rhaetic and Jurassic floras. Examples of <i>Cladophlebis</i>
    pinnules are shown in figs. <a href="#fig256">256</a>, <a href="#fig257">257</a> (pp. 340, 342). It is to
    be regretted that authors do not make more use of the generic
    name <i>Cladophlebis</i> in describing sterile fronds, instead of
    following the misleading and unscientific practice of employing
    such genera as <i>Pteris</i>, <i>Asplenites</i>, and others on wholly insufficient
    grounds.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_1230" href="#FNanchor_1230" class="label">[1230]</a> In a footnote to Fontaine’s description of Jurassic plants of Oregon, Lester
        Ward writes:—“Seward treats <i>Sagenopteris</i> as a fern, classing it now (<i>Jur. Fl.
          Yorkshire Coast</i>, 1900, p. 161) in the family Polypodiaceae, although in his
        <i>Wealden Flora</i>, 1894, p. 129, he placed it in the Schizaeaceae.” [Ward (05)
        p. 83, note <i>b</i>.] My words are “I am disposed to regard <i>Sagenopteris</i> as probably
        a genus of ferns” (<i>loc. cit.</i> 1900, p. 161). I have never referred this plant to
        the Polypodiaceae or Schizaeaceae or to any other family.

    which fills a serious gap in the botanical literature of this country.</p>

    illustrations. 15<i>s. net.</i></p>

  <p><i>Athenæum.</i> Mr Duckworth has managed to produce in his “Morphology
    and Anthropology” just such a text-book as students have long
    been asking for.... It is no easy task to have undertaken such a work and
    the author is to be congratulated on the success which has attended his
    efforts. The volume can be confidently recommended to all whose studies
    lead them in this direction.</p>

  <p class="hang"><b>Lectures on the History of Physiology</b> during the
    Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. By Sir <span class="smcap">M. Foster</span>,
    K.C.B., M.D., D.C.L. Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece. 9<i>s.</i></p>

  <p><i>Nature.</i> There is no more fascinating chapter in the history of science
    than that which deals with physiology, but a concise and at the same time
    compendious account of the early history of the subject has never before
    been presented to the English reader. Physiologists therefore owe a debt
    of gratitude to Sir Michael Foster for supplying a want which was widely
    felt.... No higher praise can be given to the book than to say that it is
    worthy of the reputation of its author.</p>

    Reynolds Green</span>, Sc.D., F.R.S., Professor of Botany to the
    Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. <i>Second edition.</i> Demy
    8vo. 12<i>s.</i></p>

  <p><i>Nature.</i> It is not necessary to recommend the perusal of the book to
    all interested in the subject since it is indispensable to them, and we will
    merely conclude by congratulating the Cambridge University Press on
    having added to their admirable series of Natural Science Manuals an
    eminently successful work on so important and difficult a theme, and the
    author on having written a treatise cleverly conceived, industriously and
    ably worked out, and on the whole, well written.</p>

    <span class="smcap">G. S. West</span>, M.A., A.R.C.S., F.L.S., Lecturer in Botany in the
    University of Birmingham. Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece and
    166 illustrations. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>net</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Nature.</i> Its aim is stated as “to give the student a concise account
    of the structure, habits and life-histories of Freshwater Algæ, and also
    to enable him to place within the prescribed limits of a genus any Algæ
    he may find in the freshwater of the British Islands.” To do this within
    the limits of an octavo volume of less than 400 pages, in which are
    numerous illustrations, is a task possible of accomplishment only by one
    very familiar with the subject and skilled in concise expression; but that
    it has been successfully done will, we think, be the verdict after testing the
    book thoroughly.... Prof. West’s treatment of his subject is instructive and
    stimulating.</p>

  <p class="hang"><b>A Manual and Dictionary of the Flowering Plants
    and Ferns.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. C. Willis</span>, M.A., Sc.D., Director of the Royal
    Botanic Gardens, Ceylon. <i>Third edition.</i> Crown 8vo. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

  <p><i>Field.</i> Taking this handy volume and a local flora, the traveller or
    student may do an enormous amount of practical field work without any
    other botanical literature whatever.... The result is a work that ought to be
    included in every library of botany and horticulture or agriculture, and it is
    certainly one that the nomadic botanist cannot afford to leave at home....
    We have used the original edition of this work since its publication, and
    have found it to be one of the most useful and comprehensive works on
    plants ever produced.</p>

  <p><i>Athenæum.</i> The whole is well abreast of modern research, and a
    thoroughly business-like volume, lucid though compact.</p>
